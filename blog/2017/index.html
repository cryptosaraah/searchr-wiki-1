<p>Starting with the next version, v0.5 — The Refactor Release, Aragon will feature an entirely revamped interface. The decision to redesign the DApp was simple. There was a need to align the app and it’s updated graphical identity, design principles and use cases to the origin of the project. Exciting!</p>

We came together as members of the same ecosystem and community to work on this plan to find an alternative that fit the needs of these cryptocurrency projects.</p>

<p><strong>Aragon Transparency Model and the unveiling of Aragon’s new Transparency Framework</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Aragon, we feel obliged to show to our community — supporters, contributors and token holders — that we are being productive, effective and using the raised funds in a responsible manner.</p>
<p>The community is very important to us, they are the ones that we’re building this project for. They support us, provide feedback and ideas on how we can all move forward while catering the needs of the users. In turn, we want to uphold our high transparency standards to keep the community up to date on what we are doing.</p>
<p>This is why we’re showcasing our model for doing things transparently.</p>
<p>This all began with our Pre-Sale Transparency Report. And recently continued with the Token Buyback Transparency Report.</p>
<p>We’ll now present you with all the different methods we’re employing. The parts of our project’s transparency model, starting with the new Transparency Framework.</p>

<p>Today, adhering to our high transparency standards, we’re ready to take the first step in our plan to extend our level of transparency — which is why we’re reporting our token buybacks.</p>
<p>In our Intended Use of Revenue post we outlined the broad estimated allocation of our funds. As the development of our project has continued, we’ve been able to narrow down some of the use cases of which we’ll use our funds for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When first designing Aragon, the goal was to have organizations run entirely trustless. Thus, we created a platform to create organizations governed by trustless and immutable code. Now, when we say that these organizations run in a trustless manner, we’re talking about how to describe the laws under which the code runs. Code is trustless when deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It won’t change at the whim of a person, it will run as designed, following the logic set forth in it.</p>
<p>Yet, it was clear that we can’t account for every possible circumstance in our code. Even if you manage to encode tons of variables into the code, there are things you cannot possibly encode because the blockchain isn’t aware about the physical world. And often, in the case of disputes, things are subjective and up to interpretation.</p>
<p>Our solution to this problem is the Aragon Network Jurisdiction. A decentralized jurisdiction to solve subjective disputes as an Aragon Network service.</p>

<p><strong>district0x, the first manifestation of the Ethereum + Aragon stack</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Software allows us to abstract away from existing functionality to focus on building.</p>
<p>At Aragon, we use Ethereum. Ethereum provides us the consensus layer to establish truth. And the ability to create smart contracts that are self-enforcing.</p>
<p>So, generally speaking, we don’t have to worry about Ethereum. We use Ethereum, driving usage to the platform, thus increasing its value. So we’re indirectly funding its further development.</p>
<p>That’s the virtuous circle that tokenization makes possible.</p>

<p><strong>How we plan to achieve transparency and inclusion for the community</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our community is everything for us. With Aragon, we want a thousand communities to flourish. Tokens align the incentives of communities and projects towards the same goals and values. But those communities are the center of where the magic happens.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago we posted our Community Governance Model for feedback from the community. We received some comments on it, and we now have the final version of the model ready. Before this, we had already worked on the model internally. I drafted the original version and Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo provided their thoughts on it.</p>
<p>Further changes might be made as things develop. But we wanted to show the community what we’ll be doing in terms of governance, transparency and inclusion.</p>
<p>The model was designed so that every community member will be treated equally. Everyone will have the same changes of participation, and our Meetings and decisions to be transparent.</p>

<li>Send ETH to the address posted on https://aragon.network</li>
<li>Send at least 200,000 gas with your transaction.</li>
<li>If your contribution is accepted, tokens will be transferred to your address in the same transaction. However, tokens will not be transferable until the sale is finalized.</li>

<p><strong>Making Aragon Code Accessible and Providing Documentation Soon</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was 12, I got my first laptop — a piece of junk with only 256MB of RAM. It was slow and literally falling apart. But this didn’t stop me from developing. Using Linux, I had the latest available software. And thanks to thousands of developers around the world, I could examine different pieces of code and learn programming.</p>
<p>The free software and open source phenomena has not only made the world a more inclusive place, but it has also increased the speed of software development — by sharing, developers no longer need to reinvent the wheel. For example, we didn’t have to build the native app wrapper or the Ethereum wallet for Aragon.</p>
<p>So when we find something that we can give back to the community, we make a point of doing so. We’ve found that by sharing code, others can learn from it (like I did as a teenager) and people will find ways to improve it.</p>

<p>When we chose what would be our main build target for Aragon, our priorities for choosing Electron + MetaMask were security and usability.  </p>
<p>Of course Aragon also runs on any Web3 environment (like Mist, Parity, Chrome with MetaMask…) but we wanted to have a build target in which we have full control over the user experience.  </p>
<p>Since we got part of the community intrigued on how our implementation works, this post hopes to explain our decisions and the challenges we found.</p>

<p>Identity is one of the most important parts when developing decentralized applications. This is specially true for Aragon, where identity is needed to know who are you doing business with or who are the people that will manage the money you are investing.</p>

<p>Today, taking a stand to help this fight, we are introducing Aragon.<br />
Aragon is everything you need to operate your company or organizational structure, on Ethereum.<br />
Aragon lets everyone create value without borders or intermediaries.<br />
Cap table, vesting, payments, voting, bylaws, fundraising and identity all in a beautiful, unified interface.  </p>
