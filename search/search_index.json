We want to empower people across the world to easily and securely manage their organizations. We provide the tools for anyone to become an entrepreneur and run their own organization, to take control of their own lives.\n\n\nBy making it possible for everyone in the world to organize, we are enabling a borderless, permissionless and more efficient creation of value.\n\n\nGOODBYE UNNECESSARY INTERMEDIARIES\n\n\n\nReclaim your independence\n\n\n\n\nAragon organizations are powered by Ethereum, a global blockchain for running unstoppable applications. In Ethereum, code and applications always run without any possibility of downtime or censorship.\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology provides a single shared source of cryptographically verified truth. This is secured by a network made up of thousands of computers all over the globe. Anyone can set up their own node where all the necessary data is replicated across the network.\n\n\nThis decentralized design ensures a borderless and permissionless way of operating, without the fear of a government or a malicious third-party interfering.\n\n\nIMAGINE A NATION WITHOUT LAND AND BORDERS\n\n\n\nA digital jurisdiction\n\n\n\n\nAragon Network will be the first community governed decentralized organization whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction, an online decentralized court system that isn\u2019t bound by traditional artificial barriers such as national jurisdictions or the borders of a single country.\n\n\n\n\nAragon organizations can be upgraded seamlessly using our aragonOS architecture. They can solve disputes between two parties by using the decentralized court system, a digital jurisdiction that operates only online and utilizes your peers to resolve issues.\n\n\nThe Aragon Network Token, ANT, puts the power into the hands of the people participating in the operation of the Network. Every single aspect of the Network will be governed by those willing to make an effort for a better future.\n\n\nAragon Core\n\n\nDecentralized application to run your organization\n\n\n\nTRANSFER TOKENS\n\n\n\nTokens represent your stake in the organization\n\n\nYour organization is in control of its funds. Transfer and assign them according to your personal needs without artificial limitations.\n\n\nFUNDRAISING\n\n\n\nGrasp the potential of a new form of crowdfunding\n\n\nUtilize the power of the crowd for funding and raise funds globally, in private or publicly, without relying on banks or financial gatekeepers.\n\n\nVOTING\n\n\n\nDecision-making by voting\n\n\nUse voting for more effective results. Votes are a secure, transparent and unforgeable way to come to a decision on major issues.\n\n\nPAYMENTS\n\n\n\nInstant payments in a few clicks\n\n\nAdding a new employee to your organization and payroll is as easy as creating a new recurring payment.\n\n\nACCOUNTING\n\n\n\nTamper-proof, effective accounting\n\n\n\n\nEvery transaction is recorded and can be verified on the blockchain at any given time\n\n\n\n\nUnprecedented level of transparency can be gained through the use of a public blockchain to engrave every entry permanently on the ledger.\n\n\nPre-established rules can automatically define your quarterly spending and budgeting.\n\n\nPERMISSIONS\n\n\n\nFlexible and resilient privilege escalation\n\n\n\n\nFine-grained permissions deliver the freedom to create an organization that will work for you.\n\n\n\n\nPermissions can be granular and assigned in fine detail. You can choose to give people a certain degree of control over the organization and privileges can be escalated easily through a voting or different mechanisms if the person isn't allowed to directly perform a desired action.\n\n\nBy assigning different permissions to people, you can create the kind of organizational structure that is best suited for your needs.\n\n\nAragon Network\n\n\nEnsuring the success of decentralized organizations\n\n\n\nPutting the power back into the hands of the users\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Network will decentralize its governance by gradually handing over control of the project to its users.\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Network will establish additional services for the organizations taking advantage of what Aragon Core provides.\n\n\nOur mission is to make the Aragon Network an autonomous organization itself, which is managed by the people using it for their mutual prosperity.\n\n\nARAGON GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS\n\n\n\nJoin us in improving Aragon by making your voice heard\n\n\nAragon Governance Proposals\n is a system for community members to join the discussion and create proposals affecting Aragon.\n\n\nEveryone is welcome to \njoin in and aid\n in forging the future of how Aragon will shape out to be. Together we can build the exciting future we want to see.\n\n\nWhy Aragon?\n\n\n\n\nAragon was born to bring transparency and independent governance to the forefront of managing an organization. We want to give the users the freedom they deserve to run their lives.\n\n\n\n\nOrganizations like companies exist to create value for their owners and users. They use the resources available to them in order to provide services and to create products.\n\n\nTheir ability to do this efficiently is hindered by factors outside of their influence. By removing unnecessary intermediaries and third parties that impose artificial restrictions and unnecessarily complex regulations, we can modernize the way organizations are run.\n\n\nOUR VISION\n\n\n\nEvolution of the internet and blockchain technology are changing the ways we interact with each other\n\n\nWe believe that the progression of modern technology solutions, such as the invention of the blockchain, are changing the incentives for people to interact with each other. We are building the tools for the next generation of organizations to take advantage of this revolution.\n\n\nExperimenting with new governance models has been a very risky endeavour during previous iterations of society. Now, for the first time in human history, we can let a thousand new governance models emerge, all from the comfort of our laptops.\n\n\nCommunity channels\n\n\nAragon Chat - \nhttps://aragon.chat\n\n\nReddit - \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/aragonproject/\n\n\nTwitter - \nhttps://twitter.com/aragonproject\n\n\nLinkedIn - \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/aragonproject/\n\n\nYouTube - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/AragonProject\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nFounders\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Lead\n: \nLuis Cuende\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuis has been awarded as the best underage European programmer in 2011, is a \nForbes 30 Under 30\n, a \nMIT TR35\n and was an Advisor to the VP of the European Commission.\n\n\nHe cofounded the blockchain startup \nStampery\n.

Essentially, the Aragon Network is an ecosystem where organizations, entrepreneurs, and investors can efficiently and securely transact without risk of technical bugs or malicious parties.\n\n\nAragon Network organizations will be built using Aragon Core, a Solidity DAO frame-work and web-based decentralized app (dApp). Initially, Aragon Core will specialize in capitalist companies but is modular enough to accommodate other types of organizations.\n\n\nThis paper first discusses the principles of an organization and the functions of Aragon Core. Next, Aragon Network\u2019s token model and network governance will be explained. Finally, it defines the two principal services the Aragon Network should implement to ensure its success; a \ndecentralized court solution\n and an \nupgrade mechanism\n. The \ndecentralized court solution\n will serve to arbitrate human conflict beyond what can be reasonably written in a smart contract. The \nupgrade mechanism\n for Aragon Core organizations will facilitate useful upgrades needed to drive mainstream adoption by non-technical users.\u2029\n\n\nThe \nAragon Project\n is built on the progress made by thousands of individuals over the last decades. However, we would like to highlight the work of some individuals that have been highly influential to Aragon:\n\n\n\n\nRalph Merkle\n, one of the inventors of public key cryptography, Merkle Trees \n[1]\n, and extensive research, including research on DAO Democracy which has influenced our thinking greatly.\n\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\n, creator of Bitcoin \n[2]\n.\n\n\nVitalik Buterin\n, creator of Ethereum \n[3]\n, inventor of the concept of DAO and author of multiple articles that have deeply influenced our vision.\n\n\nThe whole \nEthereum community\n and developers, for the work on the web 3.0 and the fact that building dApps is a reality today.\u2029\n\n\n\n\nEarly-access to the present paper was given to a number of individuals from the Ethereum and the broader Blockchain community. Authors deeply thank and acknowledge the comments and criticisms that have made the design of the Aragon Network and this whitepaper as good as it is.

Introduction\n\n\n1.1. About Aragon Core\n\n\nAragon is a dApp that lets anyone create and manage any kind of organization (companies, open source projects, NGOs, foundations, hedge funds...) on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\nAragon implements basic features of an organization like a cap table, token transfers, voting, role assignments, fundraising, and accounting. The behavior of an Aragon organization is easily customized by changing the bylaws. In addition, Aragon organizations are extensible through third party modules that interact with the organizations' contracts.\n\n\n1.2. Current limitations\n\n\nThe properties of the Ethereum blockchain present unique opportunities for the creation and management of decentralized organizations, including immutability of records, transparency, and fast transactions. But in order to satisfy multiple requirements that human beings need in order to transact and create value, a layer on top of it needs to be created to align the incentives of everyone participating in the system.\n\n\nWhen designing Aragon Core, multiple issues were addressed that would deter most people from creating, running, or interacting with a decentralized organization. These include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubjective breaches\n: Smart contracts can encode most of the possible breaches of contract, but there is always subjectivity in human relationships. A unbiased arbitration system is needed for cases where conflict is not explicitly resolved in the smart contract code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware bugs\n: The error is always between the chair and the keyboard. Code can contain bugs so the software needs to be easily upgradeable, and a sound bug bounty mechanism must exist to incentivize potential attackers to claim a bounty, rather than attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReward systems\n: Monetization around certain protocols and systems is unclear at this point. Some players will be key to making organization possible, so a simple reward mechanism is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Aragon Core organizations\n\n\n2.1. Organization specs\n\n\nAn organization has multiple needs, the main ones being:\n\n\n\n\nIdentity\n: This is the very first pillar since we need to establish each entity's identity before operating with them.\n\n\nOwnership\n: Shares are a way to reward founders, investors, advisors, partners and employees and can determine the ownership and direction of the company.\n\n\nVoting\n: The company's shareholders should be able to have a word over its actions. We will directly link this to ownership.\n\n\nCapital\n: Since a venture can be risky and may need to acquire certain goods in order to operate or grow, capital in the form of investment/loans is needed.\n\n\nPeople\n: In the end, it's human beings who build the organizations. Easy ways to on-board them (identity) and reward them (payroll) are needed.\n\n\nOutreach\n: A company needs to target their audience in order for them to buy the company's product. In the Internet era, having a domain name is enough.\n\n\nPayment processor\n: Organizations need to be paid. There needs to exist a way for them to capture payments easily.\n\n\nAccounting\n: In order to manage expenses, burn rate and make business decisions, there is a need to maintain book-keeping.\n\n\nInsurance\n: A company is usually risky and may need to buy insurance in case something unexpected goes wrong.\n\n\n\n\nSome of these create this dependency graph, which ends up being circular:\n\n\n\n\nIdentity: No dependencies\n\n\nOwnership: Depends on identity since you need to make sure you're interacting with the right entity\n\n\nVoting: Depends on ownership since ownership implies control\n\n\nCapital: Depends on voting since implies issuing shares\n\n\nPeople: Depends on capital since you need it to hire people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2. Implementation\n\n\nA. dApp runner\n\nA major advantage of the Ethereum development framework is the multiple ways of running dApps. When considering the default dApp runner for Aragon, we considered the pros and cons of multiple options (see figure 2.1.3 A for considerations).\n\n\nFigure 2.1.3 A: dApp runner comparison  \n\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-1lom{font-weight:bold;background-color:#bec0bf;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-yzt1{background-color:#efefef;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nRunner\n\n    \nDescription\n\n    \nPros\n\n    \nCons\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nMetaMask\n\n    \nGoogle Chrome plugin that brings\nEthereum capabilities to the\nChrome browser - the user can\nconfirm or deny all unsigned\ntransactions\n\n    \n- Low friction\n- Easy to install and setup \n\n    \n- Still in beta \n- Chrome only \n- Not a full node, need\nto trust their \nblockchain.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nMist\n\n    \ndApp browser that asks the user for\npermissions before interacting with\nthe dApp\n\n    \n- Full Ethereum node.\n- 'Official' Ethereum dapp browser.\n- Hardware wallets compatible.\n\n    \n- Takes long to sync\n- High friction (more\nthan 1 hour from in-\n stall to using a dapp)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nParity\n\n    \nFull node with dApp browser with a\nChrome extension\n\n    \n- Full Ethereum node.\n- Hardware walletscompatible\n\n    \n- High friction (around\n1 hour from install to\nusing a dapp)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nNative\nAragon app\n\n    \nBuilt with Electron, native app that\nruns natively on major desktop\nplatforms.\n\n    \n- Control entire user\nexperience: introduce\nnew users toEthereum to use the\napp.\n\n    \n- Tons of reimplement-\ned functionality.\n- Friction: Requires\ndownloading an app.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though Aragon Core currently runs on all the above configurations as a pure dApp, we have ultimately implemented the native Aragon app with an Electron wrapper for its intuitive installation and familiar user interface, and injected MetaMask because it provides the greatest control of the user experience.\n\n\nWe will be pushing it as the default Aragon experience, and we think it will be friendly for people who have never heard of Ethereum to be introduced to it and be managing an Aragon Core organization in less than 15 minutes.\n\n\nFigure 2.1.3 B: Native Aragon app \n0.3 alpha release\n.\n\n\n\n\nB. Identity\n\nWhen issuing new tokens or paying an employee, the organization needs to know that the assets are sent to the correct person. To address this requirement, we\u2019re initially integrating Keybase to assign identities to cryptographic entities. We are currently investigating other identity providers to integrate with Aragon, including uPort.\n\nWe have published our thinking on managing identity in dApps in the Aragon blog \n[4]\n.\n\n\nC. Permissions\n\nIdentity drives us to permissions. Example of some permissions could be:\n\n\n\n\nShareholder: Has the right to receive dividends, when emitted, and transfer the shares to another party if it doesn't go above a threshold set by the voting power.\n\n\nExecutive: Has more permissions, can do some tasks without needing approval by voting.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, decentralized trustless (or trust-reduced) organizations can allow for much more flexible relationships of different individuals with the organization. Aragon organizations have customizable bylaws that allow for fine-grain customization into who can perform an action (ie, an executive can add an employee to the payroll) or what needs to happen (ie, a voting needs to be approved to issue tokens) before the action is allowed.\n\n\nD. Reputation\n\nReputation is very valuable in free markets. We want every interaction to be rated if wanted.\n\nThis enables organizations to value the work of a contractor, for example, and the contractor to value the company.\n\nSince we have all the relationship audit trail in place, we can easily trace the interactions in order for the reviews to really be authentic. This will be fully anonymous, if wanted.\n\n\nE. Onboarding\n\nWhen opening the app, you should be able to create an Ethereum account and safely back it up.\n\nAfterwards, you should either:\n\n- Input the address of the company you want to interact with\n\n- Deploy a new company contract, in which case the dApp will automatically point itself to the contract's address\n\n\nThe onboarding process should feel familiar to anyone, not only to the cryptocurrencies enthusiasts. That's why it should be that easy.\n\n\nF. Ownership\n\nOwnership in an Aragon Core organization is transparent and transferable. Each stakeholder\u2019s holdings are public, and a stakeholder has the right to transfer ownership to another party. There are four transparent functions of ownership built into Aragon Core.\n\nThese are:\n\n\n\n\nList all stakeholders (and their holdings)\n\n\nIssue shares, arbitrarily or with parameters\n\n\nSell or transfer tokens\n\n\nIssue new tokens\n\n\n\n\nThe organization can issue tokens with limited transferability according to a Vesting Calendar or a different criteria.\n\n\nIt is important to note that all tokens issued will be compliant with the ERC20 token \n[5]\n standard. This means that a stakeholders\u2019  addresses can be linked to a name or tag, or fetched by a secure identity provider.\n\n\nG. Capital\n\nStartup organizations need to be able to quickly raise capital. For a traditional startup, this would mean riding the VC unicorn rollercoaster, crowdfunding through a third party (e.g. Kickstarter), applying for a business loan, or bothering friends, relatives, and connections for investments. Aragon Core organizations can easily issue new shares in exchange for capital without operating with a third party, both through direct sales and public offerings. \n\n- Aragon Core organizations can issue shares directly to another party when the party sends the negotiated amount of currency.\n\n\n\n\nIf an organization wants raise capital publicly, Aragon Core organizations can publish share offers in the marketplace. Investors can then directly contact to negotiate or invest in a hard limit number of shares.\n\n\n\n\nH. Rewards\n\nHiring and paying employees is unnecessarily complicated. Aragon Core simplifies the process. Aragon Core organizations will be able to put people on their payroll and issue them tokens under specific parameters, including time and/or task-based performance.\n\n\nThe user interface will let the user choose the amount to pay, the frequency, the shares to reward, and the parameters. To make the process more efficient, rewards can be in any Ethereum based token (using decentralized exchanges like the ones powered by the 0x protocol \n[6]\n) or any cryptocurrency with solutions like Cosmos or Polkadot that enable inter-blockchain currency exchange.\n\n\nIf fiat is preferred, there will also be an option to generate prefilled credit cards with fiat from the company's funds. A solution like Shake, which has an API to generate instant and anonymous VISA cards, can be directly integrated with Aragon Core.\n\n\nI. Payment processor\n\nFor incoming payments, clients will be able to buy cryptocurrencies that then can be converted to the entrepreneurs' currency choice by using services like ShapeShift. After the user has acquired the cryptocurrency, the user will proceed to the payment. But for them, it will be a single step and everything will be transparently handled in the background.\n\nWe foresee this as being the most common flow in the beginning, instead of users creating their wallets right away.\n\n\nWe will integrate with cryptocurrency exchanges and providers in order to provide a smooth user experience, similar to Stripe's.\n\n\nJ. Accounting\n\nAccounting is fully built in, and we will eventually provide connections to third party visualization services, in order not to reinvent the wheel.\n\n\n2.3 Modular Software\n\n\nAragon Core is all of the required pieces to run an organization with the minimum principles for an organization (see previous section for principle definitions) on the Ethereum network. However, organizations have unique needs that may not be available in the out-of-the-box Aragon Core software. To address this issue, we\u2019ve built Aragon Core as a modular system that allows for additional functionality to be developed on top (see section 2.5 for technical details).\n\n\nWe also envision developers using Aragon Core as the foundation for use cases not related to creating and running an organization. Potential use cases for Aragon Core that we\u2019ve envisioned include:\n\n\n\n\nPolitical election voting module - a small prediction marketplace could check if elected officials stick to campaign promises and reward those who voted for them\n\n\nContractor payment module - Pay contractors as they work for your project or achieve milestones\n\n\nAccounting module - Accounting module with advanced data visualization (beyond offered in Aragon Core)\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, all modules can be coded using standard web technologies. This lets the developer use the tool they like, while keeping strong sandboxing and security in place.\n\n\n2.4. Aragon Core summary\n\n\nAragon Core is where custom logic for organizational behavior lives. In summary, the main components of the Aragon Core application layer are:\n\n\n\n\nbylaws that define user permissions, i.e. who can perform an action,  \n\n\na governance system to make decisions,  \n\n\na capital system for issuing and controlling tokens, and  \n\n\nan accounting system to manage funds.\n\n\n\n\nEach of these components work together to meet the principles of an efficient and fair organization in a decentralized way. In addition, the modular nature of the system enables Aragon Core organizations to customize the software to meet their unique needs, or retrofit Aragon Core to fit another application (like voting for a political election). Aragon Core will implement a Module System so further functionality could be built on top.\n\n\n3. DAO architecture: Kernel, Organs and Applications\n\n\nThe following sections discuss the minimum definition of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) \n[7]\n, the principles of the DAO adopted by Aragon Core and the Aragon Network, and the structure and function of the DAO kernel.\n\n\n3.1. The minimum definition of a DAO\n\n\nWe believe a DAO should be defined at its minimum expression. This is defined as an organization that only possesses the capability to successfully update itself \n[8]\n, without losing its eternal identity.\n\n\n3.2. Principles of the DAO\n\n\nBefore defining the different components this kernel for the DAO has, let\u2019s define what are the basic principles of the DAO that we want to accomplish.\n\n\n\n\nShe is\n. We need to recognize the eternal existance of the DAO as an entity that exists in the world.\n\n\nA DAO will exist until herself decides to cease existing. At that point it will be gone forever.\n\n\nA DAO is able to self-update her most basic components and continue being recognized as the same entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe owns\n. A DAO has internal capital and therefore owns property, principally in the form of digital assets (cryptocurrency, tokens, digital property such as domain names, IP\u2026)\n\n\nShe acts\n. She can take action towards the outside world or towards herself. Her software executes computer code in the form of smart contracts.\n\n\nShe is governed\n. Besides its previously programmed actions, outside human or machine action will be able to trigger certain DAO actions.\n\n\n\n\n3.3. Kernel Functions\n\n\nA core function of the kernel is to act as a registry that defines the organs and their respective priority levels. It\u2019s important to note that each organ has a unique priority level. Thus, if a new organ is set to a priority level that already exists, it will replace the original organ.\n\n\nThe kernel is also responsible for accepting different types of entry point transactions and dispatching them to the organs using a standard API. The current entry-points supported by the kernel are:\n\n\n\n\nStandard transfers\n, value transfer in ether: Vanilla Ethereum transactions that may have value attached to them.\n\n\nPre-authorized transfers\n, value transfer in ether: The kernel supports previously signed calls to the DAO by a certain sender. The sender can pre-sign a certain transaction payload and provide the signature (r, s, v values) to the party that will execute the transaction on their behalf. This could be another contract or part of the mechanism to implement state channels.\n\n\nToken transactions\n, we consider tokens to be equally good value holding assets as ether, and we believe that at the application level they should be as powerful as ether. The kernel will accept token transfers (with data and therefore function execution) for all the standard methods. Implementations for the ERC23 \n[9]\n token receiver interface and the approveAndCall workflow from ConsenSys HumanStandardToken \n[10]\n are ready.\n\n\n\n\nNote that when the value transfer is in ether, the kernel will tokenize the ether in a standard token. This allows the DAO to interact with any tokenized asset while only implementing the sensitive logic once instead of implementing ether and tokens separately.\n\n\nFinally, the kernel functions as a gatekeeper for new transaction requests. When the kernel receives a request, it asks the priority 1 organ whether the requested transaction is allowed by that entity. If allowed, the kernel redirects the transaction to the priority 1 organ (i.e. the dispatch organ). If not allowed, the transaction fails and terminates.\n\n\n3.4 Kernel Basic Components\n\n\nA. The dispatch organ \u2013 She acts I\n\nThe dispatch organ determines if the requested transaction is allowed to be performed by the requestor. It contains the logic or asks an oracle at an upper level of the stack for the logic. As discussed in the previous section, the kernel asks for permission before performing any transactions.\n\n\nIf the transaction is not permitted, the transaction fails. If permitted, the dispatch organ triages the request to the capable organ. It determines the organ to execute the transaction by checking each organ, including itself, in order of priority. The transaction will be executed by the first organ with the capability to execute the transaction.\n\n\nB. The meta organs \u2013 She is\n\nThe meta organ self-upgrades the DAO and controls self-destruction. It is responsible for updating both the root DAO reference to the kernel and the kernel organ registry.\n\n\nC. The vault organ \u2013 She owns\n\nThe vault organ secures the funds and properties that the DAO owns (token assets) and controls the ability to spend them.\n\n\nD. The token organ \u2013 She is governed\n\nThe token organ keeps track of DAO governance tokens. In addition, the token organ controls the logic for adding, replacing and removing tokens.\n\n\nE. The application organ \u2013 She acts II\n\nThe application layer for the DAO is an organ itself. Importantly, applications ran by this organ will have very little access to other organs for kernel and organ security (i.e. sandboxing).\n\n\nHere in the application layer is where most of the logic for the organization will live. Different applications (in the form of Ethereum contracts) will be installed providing the DAO with extra functionality. We will create a module or application 'store' so organizations can easily install re-usable components in their organizations.\n\n\n4. The Aragon Network\n\n\nThe Aragon Network (AN) will be the first decentralized autonomous organization whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction that makes it extremely easy and friendly for organizations, entrepreneurs and investors to operate.\n\n\nThe Aragon Network will be bootstrapped with a very thin Constitution voted by its governance. New laws can be added and they can be amended by the governance of the AN.\n\n\nAlso a very important role of the core Aragon Network contracts will be to ensure membership of organizations in the network and check that they are following the stablished rules.\n\n\nThe network will operate by accumulating capital in the form of fees to the operation of the organizations transacting on the network. These fees will contribute to the network internal capital, that the network governance will freely allocate. The main destination of these funds will probably be service providers to the network, that will be necessary for the network operations.\n\n\nThese main services are:\n\n- Development of the Aragon core contracts that allows running decentralized organizations.\n\n- A decentralized court (Appendix A), with the possibility of freezing organizations.\n\n- A contract upgradeability service for all Aragon Core contracts (Appendix B), with a built-in bug bounty mechanism.\n\n\nWe can say that the Aragon Network will provide everything an organization needs to thrive. Looking for a real-world metaphor, the best one would be what Delaware is today for companies, investors and entrepreneurs.\n\n\nThe Aragon Network is the far more efficient digital Delaware that lives in the blockchain.\n\n\n5. The Aragon Network Token, ANT\n\n\nThe same way currency represents wealth in a macroeconomic way, ANT represents the wealth of the decentralized Aragon-enabled economy.\n\n\n5.1. Network Kickoff and ANT Issuance\n\n\nTo kickstart the network, an uncapped number of ANT will be sold based on a predetermined price function that increases over time. The funds raised from the initial sale will be transferred to the Aragon Foundation to fund development of Aragon Core and the Aragon Network (Figure 5.1 B)\n\n\nSome time after the sale ends, a Community members multisig will deploy the Aragon Network once they consider it implements its stated mission and it is secure to do so. At this moment the network will initiate and governance decisions will begin to be made by ANT token holders. (Figure 5.1 A)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1 A: Aragon Network deployment mechanism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1 B: The Aragon Token Sale mechanism\n\n\n5.2. A Continuous Token model\n\n\nANT will continue to be minted by the network following the initial sale and network deployment. Minting new tokens will have a cost, and a percentage of the fees (decided by governance) paid by organizations to join the network will fund the minting of new tokens. This creates an incentive for Aragon organizations to pay fees, as organizations that contribute more will receive more ANT. This means that the organization will be more influential in network decisions.\n\n\nThe cost to mint new tokens will be determined by ANT token holders. This will likely be a contentious decision, and one where the basic economic principles of supply and demand need to be considered. For example, consider the scenario where the cost of minting tokens is too low. More and more tokens will be added to the supply, until supply greatly outweighs demand. This is a recipe for inflation and the value of individual ANT tokens will fall. Ultimately, we believe that token holders will eventually decide on a healthy equilibrium for inflation. By weighing the opinion of every stakeholder, the market will accurately reflect the optimal minting cost.\n\n\n5.3 Network Governance\n\n\nInitially, the Aragon Network will be a liquid democracy \n[11]\n (alternatives, such as futarchy \n[12]\n, are being considered and we are actively following the research in this area) that makes token issuing, fund allocation, and network rules decisions. See figure 5.3 for more details about a sample decisions made by ANT token holders.\n\n\nThis means that when the network is deployed governance decisions will be made by ANT holders with a system of proposal and votings. This mechanism will allow for creating proposals that result in the mechanism being upgraded.\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Aragon Network governance decisions sample\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-rsd6{font-weight:bold;background-color:#bec0bf;text-align:center}\n.tg .tg-bsv2{background-color:#efefef}\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nANT issuance\n\n    \nFund allocation\n\n    \nNetwork rules\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nSet \ntoken minting cost\n: Price\nfor generating new ANT.\n\n    \nAllocate funds as a \none-time\nreward\n\n    \nAppend bylaws\n to initial consti-\ntution\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nSet tax in \npercentage for rev-\nenue\n in any asset (ETH or to-\nken)\n\n    \nAllocate funds as a repeating\nreward to a \nservice provider\n\n    \nRemove bylaws\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nSet tax in \npercentage for rev-\nenue\n in ANT (Potentially lower to\nincentivize ANT use)\n\n    \nAllocate funds as a \nglobal re-\nward\n to all token holders\n\n    \nRemove from network or freeze\norganizations that \ndon\u2019t abide\n.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n5.4. Network Adaptability\n\n\nThe Aragon Network will provide a series of basic services that are needed to make decentralized organizations widespread. However, our intent is that it will remain as global and open as possible.\n\n\nWhile the Aragon Network has some basic constitution and governance methods, everyone will be able to create another network inside the Aragon Network with a more specific set of laws. For example, you could create an organization, join the Aragon Network, and vote for a new set of laws specific to your organization. Effectively, organizations will be able to use the Aragon Network\u2019s services basic constitution and services as a framework, and build a custom set of rules to govern relationships inside organizations.\n\n\n5.5. Further uses of the token\n\n\nThe ANT token will be the native token for all of the network services that require a token, either for governance or other functionalities. For example in the case of the court, holders will be able to use their tokens to help arbitration and get a rewarded.\n\n\n5.6 Token technical features\n\n\nANT will be ERC20 compatible with some extra features on top such as clone-ability and Vesting Calendars built-in.\n\n\n6. Summary\n\n\nThe AN solves the core issues that may arise when running a fully decentralized organization, by providing services that work much better on a large scale and make Aragon organizations more efficient. It provides a way for the network to pay for its public goods.\n\n\nFigure 6: The Aragon Network flow\u2029\n\n\n\n\nAppendix: Network Services\n\n\nWe have defined the two fundamental network services the AN will hire. These may or may not be developed by Aragon Dev.\n\n\nThe following are not protocol specs but a brief definition of our research on the matter and the features that the AN would need from them.\n\n\nAppendix A: Decentralized arbitration system for the Aragon Network\n\n\n1. Driving factors\n\n\nWhen transacting in the market, trust breaches may emerge and cause disputes between stakeholders.\n\n\nThanks to the trustless nature of smart contracts, a lot of that problem surface disappears, since terms can be previously established and no part can trick them afterwards. But there are terms that are impossible to describe with code, and therefore disputes will emerge because of them.\n\n\nLet's think about these two examples:\n\n\n\n\nAn investor invests into an organization and receives some voting power. The organization founder then goes rogue and sends all investment money to his personal account. If this was an Aragon organization, the investor just had to make sure that transactions above a certain threshold have to be approved by a majority voting.\n\n\nA founder hires a new sysadmin in a SaaS organization. The employee then has access to their very valuable user database, and can steal it and use it for his own benefit. The code running on Ethereum doesn't really have any way to know what happened, therefore Aragon organizations are vulnerable to this human breach of trust.\n\n\n\n\nWe believe there should be an opt-in system for participants that want to cover themselves against these kinds of human behavior.\n\n\nThe traditional solution to this are government-powered jurisdictions. Since Aragon organizations are location and government-agnostic \u2014 they are meant to be run on the Ethereum network \u2014 we came out with a better solution.\n\n\n2. A decentralized, liquid, forkable jurisdiction\n\n\nAn Aragon Network Jurisdiction (ANJ) defines a set of contracts that:\n\n\n\n\nProvide arbitration for any given dispute between two parties.\n\n\nAllow ANT holders to vote on certain basic rules that the arbitrators will take in account.\n\n\n\n\n2.1. Entities\n\n\nEntities (such as organizations or employees) can participate in the network by giving the entire control of their contracts to the ANJ contract.\n\n\nEntities that interact between each other, for example an organization and an employee, will be able to state more details (than the ones already in the contract) of their desired relationship in any cryptographic way, for example timestamping a common document than is then signed by both parties.\n\n\n2.2. ANT functionality in the ANJ\n\n\n\n\nVoting power for multiple decisions and purposes, such as a set of general basic rules and replacing judges in the Supreme Court.\n\n\nAbility to make bonds in order to open an arbitration.\n\n\n\n\n2.3. Judges\n\n\nEntities that want to be arbitrators can post a bond in order to participate as judges.\n\n\n3. Arbitration mechanism\n\n\nIn order to open an arbitration, the applicant should post a bond. This bond will be given back if the case is resolved in their favor, and will be taken if not.\n\n\nThe arbitration petition can also be freezing, which means that it will immediately freeze the defendant's contracts (eg. in case an attacker is exploiting a bug). Only applicants that are among the defendant's organization shareholders will be allowed for this petition. (Figure A)\n\n\nFor human verdicts, the decisions of the judges are submitted using a two-step reveal of their decision for keeping it private for the whole decision making and not allowing the verdicts of other judges to influence their decision. This scheme is used in the auctions for Ethereum Name Service domain name registry. It works as follows:\n\n\n\n\nAfter deciding on the verdict, the judge will generate a secret random number and submit the hash and their decision to the court, while keeping the secret private.\n\n\nWhen the period for submitting verdicts is over, judges must reveal what their verdict was by providing their secret number. Then every one can check the validity of their verdict. Failure to reveal the secret results in a big penalization of the judge bond.\n\n\nFor preventing judge collusion, if anyone provides the secret number of a verdict for a judge (proving that he made it public), the judge will be penalized and a part of the judge bond will go to the entity that reveal the secret.\n\n\n\n\n3.1. Human judges\n\n\nWhen an arbitration is started:\n\n\n\n\nA sample of 5 judges that posted a bond will be chosen randomly from the network. If one of them refuses to participate it is sightly penalized and another one is chosen.\n\n\nThese judges look at the ANJ's basic rules, then organization-specific rules (if any) and then any other materials sent to them encrypted by the parties.\n\n\nThey post a bet plus a secret.\n\n\nWhen the arbitration is due, they reveal their secrets.\n\n\nThe bond is given back/rewarded to the judges, plus measures take place to penalize the losing party.\n\n\nThe judges that voted the right answer are rewarded with a non-transferable token called reputation, and the others are extremely penalized.\n\n\n\n\n3.2. Prediction marketplace\n\n\nIf the applicant is not satisfied with the human judges resolution, they can request an upgrade (by posting a significantly larger bond) to the next level, which is a prediction marketplace in which all the network judges can participate. For this, we can use projects like \nAugur\n or \nGnosis\n.\n\n\nWhen an arbitration is started:\n\n\n\n\nThese judges look at the ANJ basic rules, then organization-specific rules (if any) and then any other materials posted to the network.\n\n\nThey post a bet plus a secret.\n\n\nWhen the arbitration is due, they reveal their secrets.\n\n\nThe bond is given back/rewarded to the judges, plus measures take place to penalize the losing party.\n\n\nIf the result is different that the one voted by the human judges in the previous step, all judges that voted the incorrect answer are extremely penalized.\n\n\n\n\n3.3. Supreme court\n\n\nIf the applicant is not satisfied with the two previous steps, they can request an upgrade (by posting a significantly larger bond) to the ultimate level, which is a court composed of the top 9 judges by ANJ payout.\n\n\nWhen an arbitration is started:\n\n\n\n\nThese judges look at the ANJ basic rules, then organization-specific rules (if any) and then any other materials posted to the network.\n\n\nThey post a bet plus a secret.\n\n\nWhen the arbitration is due, they reveal their secrets.\n\n\nThe bond is given back/rewarded to the network, plus measures take place to penalize the losing party.\n\n\nIf the result is different that the one voted by the human judges in the previous step, all judges that voted the incorrect answer are extremely penalized.\n\n\n\n\nThese judges are paid a salary determined by the AN token holders and paid by the ANF. (Figure B)\n\n\n3.4. Incentives design\n\n\nLooking at the way the system is designed, one can argue that judges and the whole network if asked will be economically incentivized to dismiss the applicants request for arbitration and take her bond money to be split among them.\n\n\nThis makes the applicant know that chances are, if her case is not clear enough it will be dismissed. But the judges also know, that if they lie and dismiss cases just for their personal gain and the case is unanimously over ruled, their tokens/bonds will be burnt.\n\n\nThe system is designed to incentivize as less arbitration as possible and more as a safeguard for honest parties in case they are taken advantage of.\n\n\n4. Summary\n\n\nAn ANJ provides the tools needed to solve all the subjectability humans relationships bring to the table.\n\n\nIt sets the incentives right for Aragon organizations to be a part of it, since:\n\n\n\n\nParties that want to interact with the given organization will want certain guarantees in case there's a breach of trust not covered by the contracts.\n\n\nSome bugs could be stopped by opening an arbitration that could freeze all activity until the case is resolved.\n\n\n\n\nANJ's voting processes are fully liquid, but in any case between some stakeholders and the rest, it could potentially be forked. This creates incentives for their governance model to work. However, we believe an ANJ creates notable network effects because:\n\n\n\n\nInteracting with other party will likely require them to be signed up too, since otherwise it opens a surface for breaches of trust.\n\n\nIf it's extended, then all parties (including investors) are familiar with its basic rules.\n\n\n\n\nFigure A: An arbitration flow\u2029\n\n\n\nFigure B: ANJ incentives\n\n\n\nAppendix B: Aragon Network smart contract security and upgradeability strategy\n\n\nThe great thing and at the same time problem with smart contracts is that once you create them, they will exist in the blockchain and execute whatever code the developer wrote, which not always reproduces the exact intention of the creator of the contract.\n\n\nThe most important example of this is The DAO hack, where an unexpected combination of actions, resulted in the contract sending tons of its money to the hacker. In this case, a Hard Fork was done at the protocol level to prevent the leak of funds.\n\n\nAt Aragon we are creating the software needed to create and run DAOs, but in a scalable and easy way so people that have never heard of Ethereum can run their organizations using it.\n\nWe need to build a system where people unfamiliar with the matter will be able to run their organizations with the certainty that they will always be running the latest version of the software and that they are as secure as possible from attacks.\n\n\nThis service will be available to all the participant organizations in the Aragon Network, but organizations can decide to what degree they rely on it, from total upgrade control (no code is modified in my organization if I don't approve it) to no control at all (keep me safe, I don't want to know anything), to a middle ground (don't normally upgrade me, but if there is a severe security threat do it automatically).\n\n\nThis is still a work in progress, but it is an important addition to the network if we want to see thousands of secure DAOs emerge.\n\n\n1. Components\n\n\nDescribed below are different components we currently have planned for ensuring the integrity of the network and individual organizations.\n\n\n1.1. Proxy libraries for upgradeable smart contracts\n\n\nThe current way of deploying (serious) smart contract systems usually relies on performing a sound security audit of the contract, uploading it to the network and hope for the best. Since code is immutable law by default, it's not possible to roll out upgrades that may fix bugs or better map the programmer's original intention.\n\n\nOr maybe it is not a fault of the programmer of the smart contract, the consensus algorithm of the protocol is changed and the contract becomes vulnerable to a new attack vector.\n\n\nThis is a problem when a system is not upgradeable and we think that the contract that was written today will be good forever. This might be true for simple systems, but not for DAOs or Networks as complex as Aragon.\n\n\nWe have been doing research to solve this problem for months and our current solution is to try to encapsulate as much as the system business logic in Solidity libraries. Doing Library Driven Development \n[J. Izquierdo, 2017]\n and then instead of linking this business logic forever in the contract, having Proxy Dispatcher \n[M. Araoz, 2017]\n contracts that will know what version of the library each organization is linked with. We are working with the best smart contract security firm Zeppelin to create this system of proxies that dispatches to the upgraded versions of libraries and we recently published about it.\n\n\nThese techniques will allow for very thin organization contracts that just have storage and then redirect all the logic to these libraries that all organization uses.\n\n\nIn the case of a bug is found, the new version of the library is deployed and every organization in the network is upgraded depending on their settings:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic upgrade.\n\n\nNotification to upgrade, but requires approval.\n\n\nNothing at all, organization decides not to use upgradeability and handle it themselves.\n\n\n\n\n1.2. Network wide bug bounties\n\n\nThe side effect of having the same contract run by multiple organizations is that it becomes a target for hacking. On a more positive note, there are also stakeholders incentivized to allocate resources to ensure this hacking doesn't happen.\n\n\nThe network will create a bug bounty program for all the contracts organizations rely on and the network contracts. History shows that when people are economically incentivized to do good, most people finding a bug will report it to the program and get the bounty, rather than looking for ways to harm more people.\n\n\nWe are experiencing with the idea of making the bug bounty pretty automatic, by having a test suite for organization contracts on chain, and if someone is capable of breaking the tests, automatically pay them out depending on the severity.\n\n\nThe upgradeabilty mechanism of the network fits very well with the bug bounty program, because the moment a vulnerability is found, the time that passes until it is solved for everyone in the upgrade track is minimized.\n\n\n1.3. Global safe stop\n\n\nIn case a severe bug or attack is detected, the Aragon Network will be able to stop all organization contracts (every organization that opted in for this) and perform an investigation and code upgrade before restoring the service.\n\n\nWe will be developing a bot that will look at all public transactions coming to Aragon organizations and in case it detects weird behavior or unexpected state that might be a threat, it will page in someone from the Aragon Project. In case the bot determines the threat is big enough and action must be immediate, it could stop all organizations while the person in charge looks at the situation.\n\n\nThis means that in less than 30 seconds an attack could be stopped for all organizations, and fixed immediately with the upgrade mechanism. In case of a false positive, the person paged in would restart activity for every one and the downtime shouldn't be greater than 10 minutes.\n\n\n1.4. ANJ action against bad actors in an organization\n\n\nAs defined in the Aragon Network Jurisdiction document, all organizations in the network agree to be bound to the ANJ decentralized court. This protects individual organization stakeholders from the pure objectivity of smart contracts, that makes it very difficult and unproductive to encode certain things.\n\n\nOnce a case is created, the court will be able to change or undo actions in the organization contract. This is only a protective measure for stakeholders. By placing a big enough bond, a shareholder of an organization can submit a case to the ANJ and as a preventive measure freeze the organization. If the court decides the case wasn't legit, this person would lose their bond to the court (and part to the organization).\n\n\n2. Tradeoffs\n\n\nAs with most good things in life, security comes with tradeoffs.\n\nWe can imagine a triangle very similar to Zooko's Triangle (Figure A) applied to building decentralized apps, with Security, Decentralization and Ease of Use at its edges. Prioritizing a lot on one, will certainly come at the expense of the other too.\n\n\n\nFigure A: Zooko's Triangle\n\n\nWe find all three very important, but it is very difficult to have a perfect system on the three fronts. Our vision with this is to create a system where every user or organization can choose what compromises they are comfortable making.\n\n\nA. Security\n\nBy security we mean the capacity to solve to bugs or threats in a timely manner.\n\n\nB. Decentralization\n\nThe problem with the upgrade mechanism is that at the end a trusted party is the one in charge of performing the software upgrades, which is a very centralizing factor. The Network may choose to add a voting scheme, in order for the upgrades to roll out only if they have been correctly peer reviewed.\n\nThat's why our upgrading mechanism is opt-in, there will be people who will decide not to have so much security and be the ones that accept a software update for their organization.\n\n\nC. Ease of use\n\nThe case in which you optimize security and decentralization, it certainly undermines ease of use as someone needs to understand the code of Aragon to upgrade the organization, which is a huge barrier.\n\n\n3. Summary\n\n\nWith the methods outlined in this document, the Aragon Network can ensure:\n\n\n\n\nFuture bug fixes and enhancements can be added to the contracts.\n\n\nCritical vulnerabilities' impact can be minimized thanks to the bug bounty program, the global safe stop and the ANJ actions.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[1] Ralph C.

Essentially, the Aragon Network is an ecosystem where organizations, entrepreneurs, and investors can efficiently and securely transact without risk of technical bugs or malicious parties.  Aragon Network organizations will be built using Aragon Core, a Solidity DAO frame-work and web-based decentralized app (dApp). Initially, Aragon Core will specialize in capitalist companies but is modular enough to accommodate other types of organizations.  This paper first discusses the principles of an organization and the functions of Aragon Core. Next, Aragon Network\u2019s token model and network governance will be explained. Finally, it defines the two principal services the Aragon Network should implement to ensure its success; a  decentralized court solution  and an  upgrade mechanism . The  decentralized court solution  will serve to arbitrate human conflict beyond what can be reasonably written in a smart contract. The  upgrade mechanism  for Aragon Core organizations will facilitate useful upgrades needed to drive mainstream adoption by non-technical users.\u2029  The  Aragon Project  is built on the progress made by thousands of individuals over the last decades. However, we would like to highlight the work of some individuals that have been highly influential to Aragon:   Ralph Merkle , one of the inventors of public key cryptography, Merkle Trees  [1] , and extensive research, including research on DAO Democracy which has influenced our thinking greatly.  Satoshi Nakamoto , creator of Bitcoin  [2] .  Vitalik Buterin , creator of Ethereum  [3] , inventor of the concept of DAO and author of multiple articles that have deeply influenced our vision.

But in order to satisfy multiple requirements that human beings need in order to transact and create value, a layer on top of it needs to be created to align the incentives of everyone participating in the system.  When designing Aragon Core, multiple issues were addressed that would deter most people from creating, running, or interacting with a decentralized organization. These include:    Subjective breaches : Smart contracts can encode most of the possible breaches of contract, but there is always subjectivity in human relationships. A unbiased arbitration system is needed for cases where conflict is not explicitly resolved in the smart contract code.    Software bugs : The error is always between the chair and the keyboard. Code can contain bugs so the software needs to be easily upgradeable, and a sound bug bounty mechanism must exist to incentivize potential attackers to claim a bounty, rather than attack.    Reward systems : Monetization around certain protocols and systems is unclear at this point. Some players will be key to making organization possible, so a simple reward mechanism is needed.",

Voting : The company's shareholders should be able to have a word over its actions. We will directly link this to ownership.  Capital : Since a venture can be risky and may need to acquire certain goods in order to operate or grow, capital in the form of investment/loans is needed.  People : In the end, it's human beings who build the organizations. Easy ways to on-board them (identity) and reward them (payroll) are needed.  Outreach : A company needs to target their audience in order for them to buy the company's product. In the Internet era, having a domain name is enough.  Payment processor : Organizations need to be paid. There needs to exist a way for them to capture payments easily.  Accounting : In order to manage expenses, burn rate and make business decisions, there is a need to maintain book-keeping.  Insurance : A company is usually risky and may need to buy insurance in case something unexpected goes wrong.

We will be pushing it as the default Aragon experience, and we think it will be friendly for people who have never heard of Ethereum to be introduced to it and be managing an Aragon Core organization in less than 15 minutes.  Figure 2.1.3 B: Native Aragon app  0.3 alpha release .   B. Identity \nWhen issuing new tokens or paying an employee, the organization needs to know that the assets are sent to the correct person. To address this requirement, we\u2019re initially integrating Keybase to assign identities to cryptographic entities. We are currently investigating other identity providers to integrate with Aragon, including uPort. \nWe have published our thinking on managing identity in dApps in the Aragon blog  [4] .  C. Permissions \nIdentity drives us to permissions. Example of some permissions could be:   Shareholder: Has the right to receive dividends, when emitted, and transfer the shares to another party if it doesn't go above a threshold set by the voting power.  Executive: Has more permissions, can do some tasks without needing approval by voting.   However, decentralized trustless (or trust-reduced) organizations can allow for much more flexible relationships of different individuals with the organization. Aragon organizations have customizable bylaws that allow for fine-grain customization into who can perform an action (ie, an executive can add an employee to the payroll) or what needs to happen (ie, a voting needs to be approved to issue tokens) before the action is allowed.  D. Reputation \nReputation is very valuable in free markets. We want every interaction to be rated if wanted. \nThis enables organizations to value the work of a contractor, for example, and the contractor to value the company. \nSince we have all the relationship audit trail in place, we can easily trace the interactions in order for the reviews to really be authentic. This will be fully anonymous, if wanted.  E. Onboarding \nWhen opening the app, you should be able to create an Ethereum account and safely back it up. \nAfterwards, you should either: \n- Input the address of the company you want to interact with \n- Deploy a new company contract, in which case the dApp will automatically point itself to the contract's address  The onboarding process should feel familiar to anyone, not only to the cryptocurrencies enthusiasts. That's why it should be that easy.  F. Ownership \nOwnership in an Aragon Core organization is transparent and transferable. Each stakeholder\u2019s holdings are public, and a stakeholder has the right to transfer ownership to another party. There are four transparent functions of ownership built into Aragon Core. \nThese are:   List all stakeholders (and their holdings)  Issue shares, arbitrarily or with parameters  Sell or transfer tokens  Issue new tokens   The organization can issue tokens with limited transferability according to a Vesting Calendar or a different criteria.  It is important to note that all tokens issued will be compliant with the ERC20 token  [5]  standard. This means that a stakeholders\u2019  addresses can be linked to a name or tag, or fetched by a secure identity provider.  G. Capital \nStartup organizations need to be able to quickly raise capital. For a traditional startup, this would mean riding the VC unicorn rollercoaster, crowdfunding through a third party (e.g. Kickstarter), applying for a business loan, or bothering friends, relatives, and connections for investments. Aragon Core organizations can easily issue new shares in exchange for capital without operating with a third party, both through direct sales and public offerings.  \n- Aragon Core organizations can issue shares directly to another party when the party sends the negotiated amount of currency.   If an organization wants raise capital publicly, Aragon Core organizations can publish share offers in the marketplace. Investors can then directly contact to negotiate or invest in a hard limit number of shares.   H. Rewards \nHiring and paying employees is unnecessarily complicated. Aragon Core simplifies the process. Aragon Core organizations will be able to put people on their payroll and issue them tokens under specific parameters, including time and/or task-based performance.  The user interface will let the user choose the amount to pay, the frequency, the shares to reward, and the parameters. To make the process more efficient, rewards can be in any Ethereum based token (using decentralized exchanges like the ones powered by the 0x protocol  [6] ) or any cryptocurrency with solutions like Cosmos or Polkadot that enable inter-blockchain currency exchange.  If fiat is preferred, there will also be an option to generate prefilled credit cards with fiat from the company's funds. A solution like Shake, which has an API to generate instant and anonymous VISA cards, can be directly integrated with Aragon Core.  I. Payment processor \nFor incoming payments, clients will be able to buy cryptocurrencies that then can be converted to the entrepreneurs' currency choice by using services like ShapeShift. After the user has acquired the cryptocurrency, the user will proceed to the payment. But for them, it will be a single step and everything will be transparently handled in the background. \nWe foresee this as being the most common flow in the beginning, instead of users creating their wallets right away.  We will integrate with cryptocurrency exchanges and providers in order to provide a smooth user experience, similar to Stripe's.  J. Accounting \nAccounting is fully built in, and we will eventually provide connections to third party visualization services, in order not to reinvent the wheel.",

We also envision developers using Aragon Core as the foundation for use cases not related to creating and running an organization. Potential use cases for Aragon Core that we\u2019ve envisioned include:   Political election voting module - a small prediction marketplace could check if elected officials stick to campaign promises and reward those who voted for them  Contractor payment module - Pay contractors as they work for your project or achieve milestones  Accounting module - Accounting module with advanced data visualization (beyond offered in Aragon Core)   Importantly, all modules can be coded using standard web technologies.

It\u2019s important to note that each organ has a unique priority level. Thus, if a new organ is set to a priority level that already exists, it will replace the original organ.  The kernel is also responsible for accepting different types of entry point transactions and dispatching them to the organs using a standard API. The current entry-points supported by the kernel are:   Standard transfers , value transfer in ether: Vanilla Ethereum transactions that may have value attached to them.  Pre-authorized transfers , value transfer in ether: The kernel supports previously signed calls to the DAO by a certain sender. The sender can pre-sign a certain transaction payload and provide the signature (r, s, v values) to the party that will execute the transaction on their behalf. This could be another contract or part of the mechanism to implement state channels.  Token transactions , we consider tokens to be equally good value holding assets as ether, and we believe that at the application level they should be as powerful as ether. The kernel will accept token transfers (with data and therefore function execution) for all the standard methods. Implementations for the ERC23  [9]  token receiver interface and the approveAndCall workflow from ConsenSys HumanStandardToken  [10]  are ready.   Note that when the value transfer is in ether, the kernel will tokenize the ether in a standard token. This allows the DAO to interact with any tokenized asset while only implementing the sensitive logic once instead of implementing ether and tokens separately.  Finally, the kernel functions as a gatekeeper for new transaction requests. When the kernel receives a request, it asks the priority 1 organ whether the requested transaction is allowed by that entity. If allowed, the kernel redirects the transaction to the priority 1 organ (i.e. the dispatch organ). If not allowed, the transaction fails and terminates.",

The network will operate by accumulating capital in the form of fees to the operation of the organizations transacting on the network.

Let's think about these two examples:   An investor invests into an organization and receives some voting power. The organization founder then goes rogue and sends all investment money to his personal account. If this was an Aragon organization, the investor just had to make sure that transactions above a certain threshold have to be approved by a majority voting.  A founder hires a new sysadmin in a SaaS organization. The employee then has access to their very valuable user database, and can steal it and use it for his own benefit.

This scheme is used in the auctions for Ethereum Name Service domain name registry. It works as follows:   After deciding on the verdict, the judge will generate a secret random number and submit the hash and their decision to the court, while keeping the secret private.  When the period for submitting verdicts is over, judges must reveal what their verdict was by providing their secret number. Then every one can check the validity of their verdict. Failure to reveal the secret results in a big penalization of the judge bond.

We have been doing research to solve this problem for months and our current solution is to try to encapsulate as much as the system business logic in Solidity libraries. Doing Library Driven Development  [J. Izquierdo, 2017]  and then instead of linking this business logic forever in the contract, having Proxy Dispatcher  [M. Araoz, 2017]  contracts that will know what version of the library each organization is linked with. We are working with the best smart contract security firm Zeppelin to create this system of proxies that dispatches to the upgraded versions of libraries and we recently published about it.  These techniques will allow for very thin organization contracts that just have storage and then redirect all the logic to these libraries that all organization uses.

Updated Jan. 14th, 2018.\n\n\nAn \nexokernel\n-inspired architecture for modular, upgradeable, and secure DAOs\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis exokernel-inspired architecture enables modular, upgradeable, and secure Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). It implements a UNIX-inspired permissioning system with smart contracts to allow for safe and efficient control over software resources.\n\n\nSmart contracts, an essential component of the Ethereum ecosystem, can define the rules and penalties around an agreement. They can also make decisions and enforce prior commitments, such as transfering large amounts of funds. However, such significant responsibilities make smart contracts a prime target for attacks. Testing and auditing them are not absolute remedies because, inevitably, humans make mistakes.\n\n\nSo, how does one guarantee DAOs that run efficiently and securely? And how do we provide upgrading capabilities to these DAOs, to ensure the safety and evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem?\n\n\nWe present our secure decentralized operating system: \naragonOS\n.\n\n\nThis document provides a technical overview about the architecture. For a less technically-oriented introduction to aragonOS, you can check the \nannouncement blog post\n.\n\n\n1. Kernel and the Access Control List\n\n\nThe \nAccess Control List\n (ACL) is the filter which determines whether an \nentity\n has a certain role in the context of an app. It either permits or prohibits performing actions, such as an update, in a given context, as well as determining the entities with power over that permission.\n\n\nThe ACL permissioning system is inspired by UNIX. ACLs control the permissions afforded to a user in the system and can ease the transfer of said permissions. Similar to the \nsudo\n command in UNIX, users can escalate permissions, but with more flexibility and granularity.\n\n\nA reference implementation of the Kernel and its ACL can be found here: \nKernel.sol\n.\n\n\nApps and Actions\n\n\nApp\ns are smart contracts that rely on the Kernel\u2014the core of the operating system\u2014for maintaining their ACL and upgrading their code. Apps can interact with users and other smart contracts by implementing \nAction\ns, where each action is a publicly-accessible function that may or may not be protected by the ACL. Any actions that are protected are only allowed to be executed if the caller is permitted by the ACL. Because apps are upgradeable, we expect them to exist for a long period of time and be safely responsible for owning assets on behalf of the DAO (e.g. tokens and ENS names).\n\n\nApp instances are identified by their deployed Ethereum addresses. More than one instance of a particular app can be installed in a DAO at a time (e.g. multiple \nToken Manager\n instances can be installed to control multiple tokens).\n\n\nRoles\n\n\nAnother feature in ensuring security within the ecosystem is the ease of delegating responsibilities for autonomous execution. Apps can define any number of \nRole\ns, where each role grants access to one or more of the app's actions as part of the app's ACL. Any entity wishing to perform an action protected by the ACL must have the necessary permissions by having a role that is capable of executing that action.\n\n\nRoles are always unique to each app. Having a given role in one app does not grant the permission to perform that same role in other apps.\n\n\nAn entity can have many roles in one app.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\ncontract TokenApp is App {\n    bytes32 constant public MINT_ROLE = 0x1234;\n    function mint(address _receiver, uint256 _amount) auth(MINT_ROLE) { \u2026 }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nTokenApp\n is an app that defines one action, \nmint()\n, whose execution is controlled by \nMINT_ROLE\n.\n\n\nEntity\n\n\nAn \nEntity\n is any actor that is represented by an Ethereum address, such as a multisig (an account that needs multiple signatures before executing an action), an app (for example, a voting app that only executes an action if token holders vote favorably), or a simple private key controlled account.\n\n\nThe system can delegate permissions to groups of entities by implementing a \nGroup app\n. As in other apps, it can rely on the ACL for protecting important functions, such as adding or removing members of the group. When group members want to execute a specific action, the Group app acts as a proxy contract that performs the action on behalf of the group.\n\n\nPermissions\n\n\nA \nPermission\n is defined as the ability to perform actions (grouped by roles) in a certain app instance (identified by its address).\n\n\nWe refer to a \nPermission Instance\n as an entity holding a certain permission.\n\n\nWhen a permission is created, a \nPermission Manager\n is set for that specific permission. The permission manager is able to grant or revoke permission instances for that permission.\n\n\nCreate Permission\n\n\nkernel.createPermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role, address manager)\n\n\n\n\n\ncreatePermission()\n will fail if that permission has pre-existing permission instances.\n\n\nThis action is identical to \ngrantPermission()\n except it allows the creation of a new permission if it doesn\u2019t exist yet.\n\n\nA role in the ACL protects access to \ncreatePermission()\n as this important function could be used in malicious ways. When the Kernel is initialized, it also creates the permission that grants the initializing address the ability to create new permissions.\n\n\nNote that creating permissions is made mandatory by the ACL: all actions requiring yet-to-be-created permissions are disallowed by default. Any permission checks on non-existent permissions are failed automatically.\n\n\nGrant Permission\n\n\nkernel.grantPermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role)\n\n\n\n\n\nGrants \nrole\n in \napp\n for an \nentity\n. Only callable by the \nmanager\n of a certain permission. This \nentity\n would then be allowed to call all actions that their \nrole\n can perform on that particular \napp\n until the permission manager revokes their role with \nrevokePermission()\n.\n\n\nThe \ngrantPermission()\n action doesn\u2019t require protection with the ACL because an entity can only make changes to a permission if it is the permission's \nmanager\n.\n\n\nRevoke Permission\n\n\nkernel.revokePermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role)\n\n\n\n\n\nRevokes \nrole\n in \napp\n for an \nentity\n. Only callable by the \nmanager\n of a certain permission.\n\n\nThe \nrevokePermission()\n action doesn\u2019t need to be protected by the ACL either, as an entity can only make changes if it is the \nmanager\n for a given permission.\n\n\nSet Permission Manager\n\n\nkernel.setPermissionManager(address newManager, address app, bytes32 role)\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges the permission manager to \nnewManager\n. Only callable by the \nmanager\n of a certain permission.\n\n\nThe new permission manager replaces the old permission manager, resulting in the old manager losing any management power over that permission.\n\n\ncreatePermission()\n executes a special case of this action to set the initial manager for the newly created permission. From that point forward, the manager can only be changed with \nsetPermissionManager()\n.\n\n\nEvents\n\n\ncreatePermission()\n, \ngrantPermission()\n, and \nrevokePermission()\n all fire the same \nSetPermission\n event that Aragon clients are expected to cache and process into a locally stored version of the ACL:\n\n\nSetPermission(address indexed from, bytes32 indexed role, address indexed to, bool allowed)\n\n\n\n\n\nsetPermissionManager()\n fires the following event:\n\n\nChangePermissionManager(address indexed app, bytes32 indexed role, address indexed manager)\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nAs an example, the following steps show a complete flow for user \"Root\" to create a new DAO with the basic permissions set so that a \nVoting app\n can manage the funds stored in a \nVault app\n:\n\n\n\n\nDeploy the Kernel\n\n\nExecuting \nkernel.initialize(rootAddress)\n creates the \"permissions creator\" permission under the hood:\n\ncreatePermission(rootAddress, kernelAddress, PERMISSIONS_CREATOR_ROLE, rootAddress)\n\n\nDeploy the Voting app\n\n\nGrant the Voting app the ability to call \ncreatePermission()\n:\n\ngrantPermission(votingAppAddress, PERMISSIONS_CREATOR_ROLE, kernelAddress)\n (must be executed by \nrootAddress\n)\n\n\nDeploy the Vault app, which has a action called \ntransferTokens()\n\n\nCreate a new vote via the Voting app to create the \nTRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE\n permission\n\ncreatePermission(votingAppAddress, vaultAppAddress, TRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE, votingAppAddress)\n\n\nIf the vote passes, the Voting app then has access to all actions in the Vault protected by \nTRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE\n, which in this case is just \ntransferTokens()\n\n\nFund transfers from the Vault can now be controlled via votes from the Voting app. Each time a user wishes to transfer funds, they can create a new vote via the Voting app to propose an execution of the Vault's \ntransferTokens()\n action. If, and only if, the vote passes, will the \ntransferTokens()\n action be executed.\n\n\n\n\nNote that the Voting app is also able to revoke or regrant the \nTRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE\n permission as it is that permission's manager on \nvaultAppAddress\n.\n\n\nAdding Permissions\n\n\nApps have the choice of which actions to protect behind the ACL, as some actions may make sense to be completely public. Protecting an action behind the ACL is done in the smart contract by simply adding the authentication modifier \nauth()\n (passing the role required as a parameter) to the action. On executing the action, the \nauth()\n modifier checks with the Kernel whether the entity performing the call holds the required role or not.\n\n\nEscalating Permissions\n\n\nConsider kernel \nK\n, an entity \nE\n0\n, and an app \nA\n. \nE\n0\n wants to perform action \nA\nact\n on app \nA\n. The client knows, from \ninformation provided as part of the app's metadata\n, that in order to perform \nA\nact\n, an entity is required to have \nA\nrole\n. Since \nE\n0\n doesn't hold \nA\nrole\n, the client should know that \nE\n0\n cannot directly call \nA\nact\n, but that a list of entities [\nE\n1\n, \nE\n2\n, ...] do have that role on app \nA\n. The client should then show the user the multiple possible forwarding paths to pass the call to \nE\n1\n, \nE\n2\n, etc, such that \nE\n0\n is able to perform \nA\nact\n through another, higher-privileged, entity.\n\n\nCalculating a forwarding path requires knowing what \nforwarders\n entity \nE\n0\n can escalate actions through. The user or contract performing this action could then choose their preferred route to forward permissions in order to perform \nA\nact\n. For example, \nE\n1\n may be a Voting app \nV\n, so the action would be to create a new vote that, in case of being approved, would call \nA\nact\n. Since \nV\n has role \nA\nrole\n, it has permission to execute \nA\nact\n, and therefore we would have successfully completed a permission escalation.\n\n\nPermission escalations can be multiple levels deep. For example, imagine a user wants to invoke an action that requires a vote. If the only entity with permission to create a vote is the \nToken Manager app\n, then the user will have to forward their action first through the Token Manager and then through the Voting app. The Token Manager only allows a sender to forward actions if the sender owns tokens, so in this case, the user will also need to hold tokens before being able to start a vote.\n\n\nNote that a permission escalation can occur instantly or be delayed and require further action from other entities, like in the case of the Voting app.\n\n\n\n\nForwarders\n\n\nIn order to make permission escalation easier, we define a common interface for \nForwarder\ns:\n\n\ncontract Forwarder {\n   bool isForwarder = true;\n   function canForward(address sender, bytes evmCallScript) view returns (bool);\n   function forward(bytes evmCallScript);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a user wants to enact an action it cannot perform directly, it can check if there are forwarders. This checks for privileged entities that are accessible to any of the user's addresses for forwarding the action to.\n\n\nEVM Call Script\n\n\nThe \nevmCallScript\n parameter in the \nForwarder's\n interface allows for executing multiple calls with just one transaction. This is useful, for example, in the case of votings, as it allows approving multiple actions with just one vote.\n\n\nAn \nevmCallScript\n is the concatenation of multiple \nevmCallAction\ns. A \nevmCallAction\n payload is:\n\n\n[ to (address: 20 bytes) ] [ calldataLength (uint32: 4 bytes)  ] [ calldata (calldataLength bytes) ]\n\n\nWhen executed, actions in the \nevmCallScript\n are executed one at a time using the \nCALL\n opcode. If any one of the actions fails (i.e. \nCALL\n returns 0), the entire execution is reverted.\n\n\nA reference implementation for EVM Call Script can be found here: \nEVMCallScript.sol\n.\n\n\n2. Upgradeability\n\n\nUpgradeability of the system is achieved by using the \nDelegateProxy\n pattern. Kernel and apps (\nKernelProxy\n and \nAppProxy\n) both use \nDelegateProxy\n with some added functionality.\n\n\n\n\nGiven that new versions of apps or the kernel run in the exact same context as previous versions, the old storage layout must be taken into account. Inheriting from the old contract's storage before adding new storage variables is considered a safe practice. It is recommended to make sure the upgrade doesn't break the storage before pushing a new version. We will work on tooling to prevent issues with storage when upgrading.\n\n\n2.1. Kernel upgradeability\n\n\nFor the \nKernel\n to be easily upgradeable, cheaply deployable, and more efficient, we use a proxy-type construct. Deploying a new DAO is done by deploying a \nKernelProxy\n contract that just delegates all calls to a kernel implementation at a given address, while still maintaining its own storage. Upgrading the kernel implementation in the proxy is as easy as changing its reference to another implementation's address.\n\n\nNote that, although this action is fairly easy to complete, it is extremely critical to the DAO and should be protected accordingly.\n\n\n2.2. App-space upgradeability\n\n\nAs apps can be used as entities (e.g. a voting app), it is important that each app is able to keep its address fixed to maintain its identity even if an upgrade changes the underlying logic. Keeping a fixed address also simplifies the upgrade process\u2014otherwise, each upgrade would also require any associated permissions in the ACL to be updated to the app's new address.\n\n\nOne way of achieving this is through the concept of an \nAppProxy\n contract (inspired by \naugur-core\u2019s \nDelegators\n). Deploying an app via an \nAppProxy\n contract only requires a reference to the Kernel and the app identifier. When the app receives a call, it gets intercepted by the proxy's fallback function. At this point, the proxy asks the Kernel for the latest address of the app code for a given app identifier and version. The AppProxy contract then forwards the call by \ndelegatecall\ning into this address.\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that multiple \nAppProxy\n contracts can be installed in a DAO for the same app identifier (e.g. multiple \nFundraising\n \nAppProxy\n instances can be attached to the same Kernel to control multiple types of funding). As the Kernel keeps a centralized record of the latest version of the code for each app identifier, changing one reference in the Kernel effectively updates all instances of that app in that organization. These upgrades could then be delegated to another contract, e.g. the Aragon Network, in case organizations don\u2019t want to handle manual upgrades of their own apps.\n\n\nSet App Code\n\n\nkernel.setAppCode(bytes32 appId, address appCode)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis action updates the implementation code registered for a given \nappId\n, such that all future calls to the app will use the new app code. If multiple app instances are installed for the given \nappId\n, they are all updated at the same time with this action.\n\n\nNote that all calls to an app will fail if an \nappId\n has not been set for its \nappCode\n.\n\n\n3. Initialization\n\n\nThe contracts that get deployed for each Kernel and app don't contain any business logic due to them relying on a proxy-like architecture for upgradeability. The proxy contracts are merely a way to point to the logic when called.\n\n\nHowever, this architecture impedes the ability to call the Solidity constructor. Constructors are run only on contract creation but not stored as part of the account code.\n\n\nWe instead use a 'regular function' to perform initialization on each proxy. This function can only be called after the \nAppProxy\n contract has been deployed. To impede attacks in which a malicious actor tries to front-run an initialization transaction between the deployment and the legit initialization transaction, \nAppProxy\n allows you to pass an initialization payload that will only be executed on deployment, allowing for atomic initializations of apps.\n\n\nIt is important that this initialization function can only be called once per proxy. Instead of just saving a boolean when a component has been initialized, we store the block number when the initialization occurred. Clients can then use this to know from which block they should filter for events.\n\n\n4. App discoverability and package versioning\n\n\nTechnically, an app \nA\n is nothing more than a simple \nAppProxy\n contract holding a reference to a kernel \nK\n and an \nappId\n. If \nA\n doesn\u2019t have any permissions, both incoming and outgoing, set in \nK\n, \nA\n is effectively irrelevant to the DAO as nothing can call it and it cannot call anything. So the notion of installing an app is replaced with the notion of creating permissions for an app (i.e. defining what entities can do with the app and what the app can do in other apps).\n\n\nAll relevant apps in a DAO should be discoverable by traversing its ACL, checking if any addresses are \nAppProxy\ns, and checking if those \nAppProxy\ns have a reference to the DAO\u2019s kernel. If that is the case, then the apps matching those \nAppProxy\ns' \nappId\ns are considered installed in the DAO.\n\n\nApplication identifiers (\nappId\ns) should be the \nnamehash\ned\n ENS name for the app's deployed contract:\n\n\nappId = namehash(\u201cvoting.aragonpm.eth\u201d)\n\n\n\n\n\nAn app's \nappId\n can be used as the identifier for its full package (including the app's frontend and other artifacts).\n\n\nAragon owns and provides \naragonpm.eth\n as a domain for developers to register their packages under. However, the system is designed to be domain agnostic: for example, district0x could decide to have all their packages under \npackages.district.eth\n.\n\n\nApp Repos\n\n\nAfter discovering an entity in the DAO that is an app, we can fetch its \nappId\n and use ENS to resolve its Repo contract:\n\n\nrepo = Resolver(ens.resolver(appId)).addr(appId)\n\n\n\n\n\nRepo contracts conform to the original Aragon Versioning Protocol but add more on-chain checks for version upgrades.\n\n\nEach Repo has an owner which is an Ethereum address that can create new versions of the package. This ownership right can be transferred to another address by the owner.\n\n\nA Repo keeps versioned state over:\n\n\n\n\nSmart contract app code (\ncontractAddress\n): the app code is the address of the deployed version of the app. The Kernel determines which version of the app it uses by pointing to the app code address associated with that version.\n\n\nPackage content (\ncontentURI\n): defined by a location ID of where the other components of the package (e.g. frontend) are hosted (IPFS, Swarm, etc.) and the content hash for fetching it.\n\n\n\n\nBy versioning both the app code address and the package content, we can build in additional expectations for the semantic versioning of apps:\n\n\n\n\nPatch\n: Minor changes to the package contents (e.g. frontend). Update can be performed silently for users.\n\n\nMinor\n: Major changes to the package contents, but still works with the current smart contract code. Users should be notified of the update.\n\n\nMajor\n: Any change to the smart contract app code with or without an accompanying frontend upgrade. User interaction is needed to upgrade.\n\n\n\n\nA correct version upgrade for a package is defined by the following rules:\n\n\n\n\nOnly one member of the version is increased by 1. The version components to the left of the raised member must stay the same and the components to the right must be 0.\n\n\nExample: From 2.1.3 the only allowed raises are to 3.0.0 (major version), 2.2.0 (minor version), and 2.1.4 (patch version).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges to the app code address can only be done if the raise changes the major version (upgrading it to x.0.0 by the above rule).\n\n\n\n\nBy having this check performed at the smart contract level, we can load the correct version of the frontend just by looking at an instance of an app. This is done by checking that the version of a smart contract is linked to a given app by getting its \nappId\n and \nappCode\n.\n\n\nAdditional Packaging Requirements\n\n\nThe package that is stored off-chain must contain a standard \nmanifest.json\n.\n\n\nWe also introduce a specific \neth.json\n file with the following keys, to help connect an app's frontend to its smart contracts:\n\n\n\n\nabi\n: Standard \nEthereum Contract ABI\n\n\nbytecode\n: Initialization code for deploying the app code to the network.\n\n\nfunctions\n: An array of all the relevant function signatures for the contract, with its \nnatspec\n description, argument names, and whether the function is protected by the ACL or not (and which role is required, if protected). These can be automatically generated on package publish.\n\n\npermissions\n: An array of permissions the app needs to have over other entities in order to work. This will probably be dependent on initialization parameters. For example: a Finance app will need permissions over the Vault it is initialized with.\n\n\nverification\n: An object providing the needed information to independently verify the source code of the deployed code. Required values include: \ndeployTxId\n, \nsourceCode\n, and the compiler settings, solc version, and optimization settings.\n\n\n\n\nAn initial implementation of the contracts supporting package management can be found in the \napm-contracts repo\n.",

The client should then show the user the multiple possible forwarding paths to pass the call to  E 1 ,  E 2 , etc, such that  E 0  is able to perform  A act  through another, higher-privileged, entity.  Calculating a forwarding path requires knowing what  forwarders  entity  E 0  can escalate actions through. The user or contract performing this action could then choose their preferred route to forward permissions in order to perform  A act . For example,  E 1  may be a Voting app  V , so the action would be to create a new vote that, in case of being approved, would call  A act . Since  V  has role  A role , it has permission to execute  A act , and therefore we would have successfully completed a permission escalation.  Permission escalations can be multiple levels deep. For example, imagine a user wants to invoke an action that requires a vote. If the only entity with permission to create a vote is the  Token Manager app , then the user will have to forward their action first through the Token Manager and then through the Voting app. The Token Manager only allows a sender to forward actions if the sender owns tokens, so in this case, the user will also need to hold tokens before being able to start a vote.

Keeping a fixed address also simplifies the upgrade process\u2014otherwise, each upgrade would also require any associated permissions in the ACL to be updated to the app's new address.  One way of achieving this is through the concept of an  AppProxy  contract (inspired by  augur-core\u2019s  Delegators ). Deploying an app via an  AppProxy  contract only requires a reference to the Kernel and the app identifier. When the app receives a call, it gets intercepted by the proxy's fallback function. At this point, the proxy asks the Kernel for the latest address of the app code for a given app identifier and version. The AppProxy contract then forwards the call by  delegatecall ing into this address.   It should be noted that multiple  AppProxy  contracts can be installed in a DAO for the same app identifier (e.g. multiple  Fundraising   AppProxy  instances can be attached to the same Kernel to control multiple types of funding). As the Kernel keeps a centralized record of the latest version of the code for each app identifier, changing one reference in the Kernel effectively updates all instances of that app in that organization. These upgrades could then be delegated to another contract, e.g. the Aragon Network, in case organizations don\u2019t want to handle manual upgrades of their own apps.",

Constructors are run only on contract creation but not stored as part of the account code.  We instead use a 'regular function' to perform initialization on each proxy. This function can only be called after the  AppProxy  contract has been deployed. To impede attacks in which a malicious actor tries to front-run an initialization transaction between the deployment and the legit initialization transaction,  AppProxy  allows you to pass an initialization payload that will only be executed on deployment, allowing for atomic initializations of apps.  It is important that this initialization function can only be called once per proxy. Instead of just saving a boolean when a component has been initialized, we store the block number when the initialization occurred. Clients can then use this to know from which block they should filter for events.",

So the notion of installing an app is replaced with the notion of creating permissions for an app (i.e. defining what entities can do with the app and what the app can do in other apps).  All relevant apps in a DAO should be discoverable by traversing its ACL, checking if any addresses are  AppProxy s, and checking if those  AppProxy s have a reference to the DAO\u2019s kernel. If that is the case, then the apps matching those  AppProxy s'  appId s are considered installed in the DAO.  Application identifiers ( appId s) should be the  namehash ed  ENS name for the app's deployed contract:  appId = namehash(\u201cvoting.aragonpm.eth\u201d)  An app's  appId  can be used as the identifier for its full package (including the app's frontend and other artifacts).

Each Repo has an owner which is an Ethereum address that can create new versions of the package. This ownership right can be transferred to another address by the owner.  A Repo keeps versioned state over:   Smart contract app code ( contractAddress ): the app code is the address of the deployed version of the app. The Kernel determines which version of the app it uses by pointing to the app code address associated with that version.  Package content ( contentURI ): defined by a location ID of where the other components of the package (e.g. frontend) are hosted (IPFS, Swarm, etc.) and the content hash for fetching it.   By versioning both the app code address and the package content, we can build in additional expectations for the semantic versioning of apps:   Patch : Minor changes to the package contents (e.g. frontend). Update can be performed silently for users.  Minor : Major changes to the package contents, but still works with the current smart contract code. Users should be notified of the update.  Major : Any change to the smart contract app code with or without an accompanying frontend upgrade. User interaction is needed to upgrade.   A correct version upgrade for a package is defined by the following rules:   Only one member of the version is increased by 1. The version components to the left of the raised member must stay the same and the components to the right must be 0.  Example: From 2.1.3 the only allowed raises are to 3.0.0 (major version), 2.2.0 (minor version), and 2.1.4 (patch version).    Changes to the app code address can only be done if the raise changes the major version (upgrading it to x.0.0 by the above rule).   By having this check performed at the smart contract level, we can load the correct version of the frontend just by looking at an instance of an app. This is done by checking that the version of a smart contract is linked to a given app by getting its  appId  and  appCode .",

The ecosystem is evolving very quickly and we don't know what\ninteresting features we may want to add that will make the 1.0 release more appealing.\n\n\nSome ideas of what we might work on here:\n\n\nPrivacy-focused companies\n\n\nzkSnarks\n could provide companies with way more privacy. Private voting and ownership are\nvery interesting concepts we are researching about.\n\n\nDifferent governance mechanisms\n\n\nUntil now Aragon companies and the Network will be simple liquid democracy based\nentities.  \n\n\nWe are closely following research and experimentation on other governance mechanisms\nsuch as \nFutarchy\n.\n\n\n1.0 \u2014 The Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect to start marketing Aragon to the mainstream with this release.

Further audits and public bug\nbounty programs are scheduled to begin in early January 2018.\n\n\nAll the changes triggered as result of the audit can be found in the \naragonOS\n and \naragon-apps\n repos\n\n\nThe original PDF report has been converted to Markdown for easier reading. You can download unmodified report from the auditor here:\n\n\nDownload original PDF\n\n\nThe repository \naragon-core\n has been renamed to \naragonOS\n after this audit took place and that change has been reflected in this document. See the PDF file above for the untouched original report.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis audit report was undertaken by \n@adamdossa\n for the purpose of providing feedback to Aragon.\n\nIt has been written without any express or implied warranty.\n\n\nThe review focussed on the Solidity contract code in these repos, and covered:\n\n\n\n\npossible attack vectors\n\n\nmismatches between logic and documentation\n\n\npossible code improvements\n\n\nconfusing functionality or naming\n\n\n\n\nThe review was performed using the code tagged with \naudit1\n at the following commits.\n\n\naragonOS\n:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/audit1/contracts\n\n\naragon-apps\n:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/audit1/apps\n\n\nWe used RocketChat to coordinate the review and help resolve questions during the review process.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOverall the code structure was readable, well-documented and structured coherently and consistently.\n\n\nFunctions largely conform to the best practices at:\n\n\nhttps://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/style-guide.html\n\nmaking the structure and code easy to parse and understand.\n\n\nThe codebase also included comprehensive testing suites, using the Truffle testing framework. The Aragon team also employs a coverage framework and linter process to ensure their code remains consistent and testing comprehensive.\n\n\nThe team was responsive, measured and prompt in their responses and feedback during the process.\n\n\nGeneral Comments\n\n\n\n\nThere were a few functions that were missing explicit function visibility modifiers. This has been\nreviewed and corrected (including linter updates) via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/pull/33\n\n\nIn addition to the below there are a few miscellaneous fixes and improvements that have been made, including additional testing coverage and minor fixes. These include:\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/49253097831a6f979c68c309ae0c6c00c325af4d\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/c239847065eebb2f2b3ea2dbc264b8a25cd788cd\n\nas well as many other incremental improvements which have been made during and after this audit process.\n\n\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/kernel\n\n\nThese contracts form the core Kernel implementation. The Kernel manages app and Kernel permissions and provides a layer of indirection to access apps (allowing apps, including the Kernel, to be upgraded as necessary).\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nThere were a few areas of the documentation which were either out-dated, or possibly confusing.\n\nThese included:\n\n\n\n\ndescription of \nGrant Permission\n which has now been amended to make the conditions of this operation clearer.\n\n\nmaking the separation between instantiation and initialisation clearer.\n\n\ncorrecting some minor mistakes in the example code for \nCreate Permission\n\n\n\n\nThese issues have now been resolved in a number of pull requests:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/32b6f1cfb396c8974a2be4e925111e33dbe9b275\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/b2cde71d3faa8212a3124813901b8d5280d93c76\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/c3a734c651a04052cea0dc80753079a4a6a9ab82\n\n\nPossible Improvements\n\n\nSome possible future improvements were identified, specifically:\n\n\n\n\nevents being triggered when permissions were used.\n\n\nmanaging the instantiation / initialisation of contracts (see below section for more details).\n\n\ncontinuing to work on documentation to make the permission framework as clear as possible.\n\n\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/apps \nand\n aragonOS/contracts/common\n\n\nThese contracts contains the logic required for both proxy contracts (which allow the underlying \"business logic\" contracts to be upgraded) and forwarding (which allows entities to forward transaction scripts to other entities for execution).\n\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\nPre-Byzantium logic could now be removed from \nDelegateProxy\n as \nreturndatasize\n opcodes are now available. This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/145\n  \n\n\nThe use of \ndelegatecall\n to execute underlying App logic is a clever way of preserving state and Ether value in the \nDelegateProxy\n whilst using the code / business logic of an upgradable \nApp\n contract. The below represent areas that could be clarified in the documentation, rather than bugs in the code.\n\n\nSince the \nApp\n code is expected to have state / storage, this imposes a limitation that any new upgraded version of the \nApp\n has a superset of the previous contract which it is replacing.\n\n\nSince state is maintained in the \nDelegateProxy\n contract, not the underlying \nApp\n contract, this may cause some practical issues with third-party apps such as exchanges or etherscan.io (for example I don't believe the \"Read Contract\" functionality on etherscan.io would work as the ABI wouldn't have the relevant functions on the \nDelegateProxy\n contract, and the state on the \nApp\n contract wouldn't reflect updates).\n\n\nThere were a few areas of documentation which use inconsistent terminology (e.g. scaling vs. forwarding) which have been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/c3a734c651a04052cea0dc80753079a4a6a9ab82\n\n\nOne of the identified issues related to the instantiation and initialisation of \nAppProxy\n contracts not being atomic. In the expected use-cases, where \nAppProxy\n contracts are instantiated and initialised through a factory process (within a single atomic transaction) this is not problematic, but there is\nsome potential for this structure to be abused in unexpected use-cases, allowing a malicious user to front-run \nAppProxy\n contracts. The Aragon team discussed various options internally and an approach was implemented to allow an optional \ninitializePayload\n to be passed to the \nAppProxy\n constructor, which can be used to initialise the contract as part of its instantiation.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/148\n\n\n\n\nPossible Improvements\n\n\n\n\nGiven the use of \ndelegatecall\n, the documentation could clarify the intention as to whether \nApp\n contracts are designed to be used as factory contracts, or redeployed for each Aragon organisation.\n\n\nIt may be sensible to make the \n10000\n gas in \nAppProxy\n a variable that can be modified to account for any future changes to opcode gas costs for \ndelegatecall\n.\n\n\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/voting/contracts\n\n\nThis contract allows votes to take place on arbitrary actions, using the MiniMeToken to determine voting power of token holders.\n\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\nThe \nVoterState\n of \nAbsent\n doesn't seem to be used anywhere - not sure if this is in for some future purpose perhaps, if not it could be removed.\n\n\nThe \nVoting\n app automatically executed a vote payload once the outcome of the vote was beyond doubt. Whilst this is useful functionality, it made it hard for a voter to estimate gas requirements and the effect of their vote transaction deterministically (as the outcome depended on whether or not the vote tipped the balance). A boolean parameter has now been introduced to allow a voter to specify whether or not they want their vote to automatically execute the vote payload (if appropriate) via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/ae8a92e05c9bb90892da24e09ba1354fe49514ac\n\n\n\n\nPossible improvements\n\n\n\n\nCurrently the duration of a vote is fixed on initialisation of the \nVoting\n contract - it may be worth considering making this a per-Vote variable instead to allow for both long and short-dated votes. Since the \n_minAcceptQuorumPct\n can be modified during the lifetime of the contract, it may be that users also want to change \nvoteTime\n as well.\n\n\nThe event \nCastVote\n should include the number of votes being cast to allow easier off-chain tracking of vote status. This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/8ea8cda2d190a695d2a7ec0d7680c4c8bafd5054\n\n\nWhen modifying the \n_minAcceptQuorumPct\n through \nchangeMinAcceptQuorumPct\n it may be worth emitting an event for this change. This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/03f26441f60a4dedd042749972218fb6dadaa9de\n\n\nWhen creating a new vote through the \nforward\n method, it may be worth putting a non-blank \n_metadata\n in to make it clearer to track where the vote has come from. This could incorporate the forwarding entities address.\n\n\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/token-manager/contracts\n\n\nThis contract manages token actions through the MiniMeToken contract (either wrapping another token, or natively).\n\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\ncanForward\n allows holders of tokens which have not yet vested to forward request - this may be intentional, but worth clarifying in the documentation.\n\n\nIt is technically possible for a single \nTokenManager\n to be set as the controller for multiple \nMiniMeToken\n contracts. It may be worth asserting in the \nTokenController\n functions (\nonApprove\n, \nonTransfer\n, \nproxyPayment\n) that \nmsg.sender\n matches the expected \ntoken\n value, to avoid any\nmisconfiguration.\n\n\n\n\nPossible Improvements\n\n\n\n\nThe vesting model follows broadly the Zeppelin approach. In my experience clients have often wanted a simpler model with a single cliff date, upon which all tokens vest.

This has now been resolved via:  https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/145     The use of  delegatecall  to execute underlying App logic is a clever way of preserving state and Ether value in the  DelegateProxy  whilst using the code / business logic of an upgradable  App  contract. The below represent areas that could be clarified in the documentation, rather than bugs in the code.  Since the  App  code is expected to have state / storage, this imposes a limitation that any new upgraded version of the  App  has a superset of the previous contract which it is replacing.  Since state is maintained in the  DelegateProxy  contract, not the underlying  App  contract, this may cause some practical issues with third-party apps such as exchanges or etherscan.io (for example I don't believe the \"Read Contract\" functionality on etherscan.io would work as the ABI wouldn't have the relevant functions on the  DelegateProxy  contract, and the state on the  App  contract wouldn't reflect updates).  There were a few areas of documentation which use inconsistent terminology (e.g. scaling vs. forwarding) which have been resolved via:  https://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/c3a734c651a04052cea0dc80753079a4a6a9ab82  One of the identified issues related to the instantiation and initialisation of  AppProxy  contracts not being atomic. In the expected use-cases, where  AppProxy  contracts are instantiated and initialised through a factory process (within a single atomic transaction) this is not problematic, but there is\nsome potential for this structure to be abused in unexpected use-cases, allowing a malicious user to front-run  AppProxy  contracts. The Aragon team discussed various options internally and an approach was implemented to allow an optional  initializePayload  to be passed to the  AppProxy  constructor, which can be used to initialise the contract as part of its instantiation.  https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/148",

This means that in \ndelegatedFwd(target, msg.data)\n, \ntarget\n could potentially be delegating to a malicious contract. As far as I know, exploiting this would be extremely difficult, but it should be clear in the surrounding documentation that the \nkernel\n \nMUST\n be carefully set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKernelProxy\n should fail on construction if \n_kernelImpl\n is not a contract\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol\n:\n\n\ndelegatedFwd(kernelImpl, msg.data)\n will always fail if \nkernelImpl == 0\n or is not a contract. In such a case, it would also be impossible to run \nupgradeKernel()\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKernelProxy\ns' initialization can be front-runned:\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol\n:\n\n\ninitialize()\n is public and accessible to anyone after the proxy is deployed. This should at least be highlighted in documentation for \nKernel.initialize()\n and the \nKernelProxy\n so as to make sure users always create and initialize these proxies in one atomic transaction, but a better solution would be to introduce the same \ninitializePayload\n that is in \nAppProxy\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKernel.revokePermission()\n can be front-runned:\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol\n:\n\n\nThere are many possible outcomes when \nrevokePermission()\n races with an entity wishing to perform an action associated with the revoked role. As in all front-running cases, the entity learning of the revocation has the upper hand as he can send his transactions with much higher gas prices. I don't see any good way around this, as this is a pretty general problem plaguing all systems implementing revocable controls. It may be a good idea to note this in the comments and associated documentation. The best way around the problem is just to never give permissions to an entity you don't entirely trust, but this is obviously not very practical (yet).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow-severity\n\n\n\n\nAPMRegistry.NewRepo\n event should index its \nid\n and \nrepo\n fields\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/apm/ApmRegistry.sol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepo\n should use \npragma solidity 0.4.18;\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/apm/Repo.sol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppProxy\n should fail if \n_appId\n is \nbytes32(0)\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/apps/AppProxy.sol\n:\n\n\nA valid \nappId\n will  never be \nbytes32(0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAragonApp\n could be split into \nAragonApp\n and \nInitializableAragonApp\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/apps/AragonApp.sol\n:\n\n\nApps that don't need to initialize don't need to inherit from \nInitializable\n. However, doing this would make it difficult for an app to include the ability to initialize later on, although it's debatable whether or not that functionality would be desirable (what does it mean for already created apps if the app changes to require initialization?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherToken\n's \nwrap()\n, \nwrapAndCall()\n, and \nwithdraw()\n should be made external\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/common/EtherToken.sol\n:\n\n\nI don't see many use cases for subclassing this contract (since it's specific to ETH) so any functions not used internally could be made \nexternal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherToken\n's \nwrap()\n could also take a receiver address\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/common/EtherToken.sol\n:\n\n\nSeems odd that \nwrap()\n always deposits to the \nmsg.sender\n while \nwrapAndCall()\n allows you to choose who to send it to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherToken.withdraw()\n includes an unnecessary check:\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/common/EtherToken.sol\n:\n\n\nStrictly speaking, \nrequire(balances[msg.sender] \n= _amount)\n is unnecessary since \nbalances[msg.sender].sub(_amount)\n will also do this check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelegateProxy.delegatedFwd()\n could take a \ngas\n parameter:\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/common/DelegateProxy.sol\n:\n\n\nIt may be useful to provide a control over how much gas is provided to the \ndelegatecall\n in case of gas price changes or particular uses (e.g. super large returns or gas-restricted calls). I don't think this is a pressing concern, however, and it may be suggesting additional flexibility for the sake of flexibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIForwarder.isForwarder()\n should be made external\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/common/IForwarder.sol\n:\n\n\nThere's no reason to ever use \nisForwarder()\n internally... right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitializable\n library instances can be initialized:\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/common/Initializable.sol\n:\n\n\nNot a big deal because library contracts' states are meaningless, but it'd still be nice if \nInitializable\n provided a way for these library contracts to be initialized on creation (e.g. by providing a constructor that sets \ninitializationBlock\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENSSubdomainRegistrar.createNameAndPoint()\n should accept an \nowner\n parameter\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/ens/ENSSubdomainRegistrar.sol\n:\n\n\nMirror \ncreateName()\n's interface and increase flexibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNomenclature:\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/common/EVMCallScript.sol\n:\n\n\nEVMCallScriptRunner.LogScriptCall\n event should be named \nScriptCall\n to adhere to the same pattern as all other events (no \nLog\n prefix)\n\n\n\n\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/kernel/IKernel.sol\n:\n\n\nFunction names and arguments have a naming mismatch; names are called in terms of \npermission\ns whereas arguments are always called in terms of \nrole\ns\n\n\nChangePermissionManager\n event could have its \nmanager\n parameter renamed as \nnewManager\n for clarity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments:\n\n\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/apps/AppProxy.sol\n and \naragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol\n:\n\n\nFallback function: a note indicating that no \nreturn\n statement is needed for \ndelegatedFwd()\n to return a \nbytes32\n value would be nice (it is puzzling at first glance why the comments say they return data but the function signatures and bodies don't contain \nreturn\ns; it's additionally puzzling because Solidity disallows fallbacks from returning). Also, I believe it's more than just a \nbytes32\n being returned now (post Byzantium); it should be the entire return?\n\n\n\n\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/common/DelegateProxy.sol\n:\n\n\nWould be nice to have an \n@returns\n comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/common/IForwarder.sol\n:\n\n\nWould be nice to have some comments documenting the interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/common/Initializable.sol\n:\n\n\ninitialized()\n: \nFunction to be called by subclassed contract to signal it has been initialized.\n may better reflect the intended usage of \ninitialized()\n\n\n\n\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/kernel/IKernel.sol\n:\n\n\nMight be nice to move some of the comments detailing functions from \naragonOS/contracts/kernel/Kernel.sol\n to the interface contract\n\n\n\n\n\n\naragonOS/contracts/kernel/Kernel.sol\n:\n\n\nIt may be useful to have a detailed example for each complex mapping, e.g: \nmapping (address =\n mapping (address =\n mapping (bytes32 =\n bool))) permissions\n could have \n(entity =\n (app =\n (role =\n hasPermission)))\n\n\nRemove all instances of \nparent\n and replace with \nmanager\n\n\nsetAppCode()\n: suggest changing \n@dev\n comment to \n@dev Changes implementation address for all installed apps with \\\n_appId`.

The main advantage of this is being able to avoid any index manipulation targeted for humans (i.e. forcing some arrays to start at \n1\n because \n0\n doesn't make intuitive sense). Also, a pseudorandom \nbytes32\n value arguably makes more sense as an identifier than an incrementing \nuint\n. Clients could listen to the logs (or rebuild the hashes, if \ncurrentNumOfType\n is known) to build their UIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/finance/contracts/Finance.sol\n:\n\n\nShould add clarifications as to whether a token must be added to the budget before being allowed to create payments\n\n\nl204 has a comment stating this to be the case, but the associated \nrequire()\n does not actually complete this check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments may be beneficial for mappings (e.g. \ntoken =\n budget\n for \nbudgets\n)\n\n\ntokenStatement\n should be renamed \ntokenStatements\n\n\nConsider increasing the minimum \nperiodDuration\n to be greater than one second\n\n\nExtremely small \nperiodDurations\n can cause the app to be onerous to maintain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeposit logic may benefit from being abstracted into internal \n_deposit()\n and \n_depositFrom()\n methods\n\n\nImprove DRYness when the combo of \n_recordIncomingTransaction()\n and \ntoken.transfer()\n or \ntoken.transferFrom()\n are used\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnewPayment()\n acts differently for one-time, immediate payments than repeating payments when the payment fails\n\n\nOne time payments cause a revert if they cannot be immediately executed while repeating payments will log a \nPaymentFailure\n event. It may be beneficial for both cases to match so as to avoid unexpected behaviour for users. One way of accomplishing this would be to cache a one-time payment if it cannot be immediately executed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsetBudget()\n should check that \n_amount\n is greater than or equal to the current period's expenses\n\n\nChanging a budget to be smaller than the current period's expenses will likely be confusing for clients and should be avoided\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove payment date check from \nexecutePayment()\n and \nreceiverExecutePayment()\n\n\nrequire(nextPaymentTime(_paymentId) \n= getTimestamp())\n is already checked in \n_executePayment()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nview\n getters can be made \nexternal\n\n\nnextPaymentTime()\n (l402): \npayment\n should be a \nstorage\n variable\n\n\nnextPaymentTime()\n's casting from uint256 to uint64 (l410) should have an associated \nrequire(nextPayment \n= MAX_UINT64)\n\n\ngetTimestamp()\n should return \nuint64\n to conform with other dates\n\n\n_canMakePayment()\n should be \nview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTokenManager\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/token-manager/contracts/TokenManager.sol\n:\n\n\ntransferable\n and \nlogHolders\n could be grouped together to save some storage\n\n\nassignVested()\n could be renamed to \nassignVesting()\n to clarify that it creates a vesting for an entity rather than assigning already vested tokens to an entity\n\n\nallHolders()\n and \nspendableBalanceOf()\n could be made external\n\n\nisBalanceIncreaseAllowed()\n should use \n.add()\n: \nreturn token.balanceOf(_receiver).add(_inc) \n= maxAccountTokens\n\n\ntransferableBalance()\n's \n_time\n parameter should be of \nuint64\n for consistency with other dates\n\n\ncalculateNonVestedTokens()\n should sanitize its time inputs: \nrequire(start \n= cliff \n cliff \n= vesting)\n\n\ncalculateNonVestedTokens()\n's \nvestedTokens\n calculation could be simplified to \nuint256 vestedToken = tokens.mul((time - start) / (vesting - start))\n (assuming sanity checks above were performed)\n\n\n_assign()\n should also call \n_logHolderIfNeeded(_receiver)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoting\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/voting/contracts/Voting.sol\n:\n\n\nAdd veto role: give an entity the ability to decide a vote unianimously\n\n\nExample use case: give certain entities (e.g. President) extra power to decide votes more quickly (allows them to have more power without being assigned other permissions).\n\n\nExample use case: in a stalemate due to not reaching \nminAcceptQuorumPct\n, a DAO may want to restart a vote with a lower \nminAcceptQuorumPct\n. At that point, the previous vote could be vetoed to be unsuccessful to allow a new vote to start right away, rather than having to wait for it to expire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllow \nminAcceptQuorumPct\n to be provided when creating a new vote\n\n\nThe main utility I could gather from allowing this parameter to be modified was that a DAO may choose different levels of importance for different votes (of the same type, i.e. time and required support), where size of quorum is a proxy for importance. However, given the current implementation, it would require multiple steps to change the \nminAcceptQuorumPct\n for a single vote (you'd have to change it, create a vote, and then change it back).\n\n\nImplementing this could be done via an overload, storing the quorum percentage given on initialization as the default percentage. \nforward()\n should always use the default percentage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \nstruct Vote\n, \nstartDate\n and \nexecuted\n could be grouped together to save some storage\n\n\nstruct Vote\n's \ntotalVoters\n could be renamed to \ntotalPossible\n to avoid confusion over whether it holds the total number of individual voters or total possible votes\n\n\ncanExecute()\n should use \n.add()\n (l153): \nuint256 totalVotes = vote.yea.add(vote.nay)\n\n\nview\n getters can be made \nexternal\n\n\n_isVoteOpen()\n should cast up rather than down: \nreturn now \n uint256(vote.startDate).add(uint256(voteTime)) \n !vote.executed;\n\n\n_isValuePct()\n could be renamed to \n_isAtLeastPct()\n for clarity\n\n\n_isValuePct()\n should use \n.mul()\n (l268): \nuint256 m = _total.mul(_pct)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools\n\n\nSolgraph\n\n\n\n\nOnly \nEtherToken.sol\n was flagged for having an untrusted \ntransfer()\n to another contract (see \nOyente\n for a note on this).\n\n\nNoted that solgraph is non-exhaustive and only assumes contracts to be untrusted if they send funds to an external contract. However, it can be useful for quickly telling which contracts are likely to be more complicated, as well as helping visualize the interdependencies between functions in a contract.\n\n\n\n\nTest details\n\n\nCreated function graphs via:\n\n\n# Globstar and multiple variable substitutions may have to be turned on in your shell\n\n\n\n# aragonOS\n\n\nfor\n contract in contracts/**/*.sol\n;\n \ndo\n\n    \necho\n \nGraphing\n \n${\ncontract\n}\n\n    mkdir -p solgraph/\n${${\ncontract\n#contracts/\n}\n%/*\n}\n\n    solgraph \n${\ncontract\n}\n \n|\n dot -Tpng \n solgraph/\n${${\ncontract\n#contracts/\n}\n%\n\\.\nsol\n}\n.png\n\ndone\n\n\n\n# aragon-apps\n\nmkdir -p solgraph/aragon-apps\n\n\nfor\n contract in aragon-apps/apps/**/contracts/*.sol\n;\n \ndo\n\n    \necho\n \nGraphing\n \n${\ncontract\n}\n\n    solgraph \n${\ncontract\n}\n \n|\n dot -Tpng \n solgraph/aragon-apps/\n${${\ncontract\n#*/contracts/\n}\n%\n\\.\nsol\n}\n.png\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: currently requires \nmy fork of \nsolgraph\n (install via \nnpm install -g git+https://github.com/sohkai/solgraph.git\n)\n\n\nOyente\n\n\n\n\nIn non-lib files, Oyente only reported a single potential error: \nEtherToken.sol\n (transaction order dependency)\n\n\nOn analysis, this does not seem to be a real problem.

This means that in  delegatedFwd(target, msg.data) ,  target  could potentially be delegating to a malicious contract. As far as I know, exploiting this would be extremely difficult, but it should be clear in the surrounding documentation that the  kernel   MUST  be carefully set.      KernelProxy  should fail on construction if  _kernelImpl  is not a contract  aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol :  delegatedFwd(kernelImpl, msg.data)  will always fail if  kernelImpl == 0  or is not a contract. In such a case, it would also be impossible to run  upgradeKernel() .      KernelProxy s' initialization can be front-runned:  aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol :  initialize()  is public and accessible to anyone after the proxy is deployed. This should at least be highlighted in documentation for  Kernel.initialize()  and the  KernelProxy  so as to make sure users always create and initialize these proxies in one atomic transaction, but a better solution would be to introduce the same  initializePayload  that is in  AppProxy .      Kernel.revokePermission()  can be front-runned:  aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol :  There are many possible outcomes when  revokePermission()  races with an entity wishing to perform an action associated with the revoked role. As in all front-running cases, the entity learning of the revocation has the upper hand as he can send his transactions with much higher gas prices. I don't see any good way around this, as this is a pretty general problem plaguing all systems implementing revocable controls. It may be a good idea to note this in the comments and associated documentation. The best way around the problem is just to never give permissions to an entity you don't entirely trust, but this is obviously not very practical (yet).",

However, doing this would make it difficult for an app to include the ability to initialize later on, although it's debatable whether or not that functionality would be desirable (what does it mean for already created apps if the app changes to require initialization?).      EtherToken 's  wrap() ,  wrapAndCall() , and  withdraw()  should be made external  aragonOS/contracts/common/EtherToken.sol :  I don't see many use cases for subclassing this contract (since it's specific to ETH) so any functions not used internally could be made  external      EtherToken 's  wrap()  could also take a receiver address  aragonOS/contracts/common/EtherToken.sol :  Seems odd that  wrap()  always deposits to the  msg.sender  while  wrapAndCall()  allows you to choose who to send it to      EtherToken.withdraw()  includes an unnecessary check:  aragonOS/contracts/common/EtherToken.sol :  Strictly speaking,  require(balances[msg.sender]  = _amount)  is unnecessary since  balances[msg.sender].sub(_amount)  will also do this check      DelegateProxy.delegatedFwd()  could take a  gas  parameter:  aragonOS/contracts/common/DelegateProxy.sol :  It may be useful to provide a control over how much gas is provided to the  delegatecall  in case of gas price changes or particular uses (e.g. super large returns or gas-restricted calls). I don't think this is a pressing concern, however, and it may be suggesting additional flexibility for the sake of flexibility.

It may be beneficial for both cases to match so as to avoid unexpected behaviour for users. One way of accomplishing this would be to cache a one-time payment if it cannot be immediately executed.    setBudget()  should check that  _amount  is greater than or equal to the current period's expenses  Changing a budget to be smaller than the current period's expenses will likely be confusing for clients and should be avoided    Remove payment date check from  executePayment()  and  receiverExecutePayment()  require(nextPaymentTime(_paymentId)  = getTimestamp())  is already checked in  _executePayment()    view  getters can be made  external  nextPaymentTime()  (l402):  payment  should be a  storage  variable  nextPaymentTime() 's casting from uint256 to uint64 (l410) should have an associated  require(nextPayment  = MAX_UINT64)  getTimestamp()  should return  uint64  to conform with other dates  _canMakePayment()  should be  view      TokenManager  aragon-apps/apps/token-manager/contracts/TokenManager.sol :  transferable  and  logHolders  could be grouped together to save some storage  assignVested()  could be renamed to  assignVesting()  to clarify that it creates a vesting for an entity rather than assigning already vested tokens to an entity  allHolders()  and  spendableBalanceOf()  could be made external  isBalanceIncreaseAllowed()  should use  .add() :  return token.balanceOf(_receiver).add(_inc)  = maxAccountTokens  transferableBalance() 's  _time  parameter should be of  uint64  for consistency with other dates  calculateNonVestedTokens()  should sanitize its time inputs:  require(start  = cliff   cliff  = vesting)  calculateNonVestedTokens() 's  vestedTokens  calculation could be simplified to  uint256 vestedToken = tokens.mul((time - start) / (vesting - start))  (assuming sanity checks above were performed)  _assign()  should also call  _logHolderIfNeeded(_receiver)      Voting  aragon-apps/apps/voting/contracts/Voting.sol :  Add veto role: give an entity the ability to decide a vote unianimously  Example use case: give certain entities (e.g. President) extra power to decide votes more quickly (allows them to have more power without being assigned other permissions).  Example use case: in a stalemate due to not reaching  minAcceptQuorumPct , a DAO may want to restart a vote with a lower  minAcceptQuorumPct . At that point, the previous vote could be vetoed to be unsuccessful to allow a new vote to start right away, rather than having to wait for it to expire.    Allow  minAcceptQuorumPct  to be provided when creating a new vote  The main utility I could gather from allowing this parameter to be modified was that a DAO may choose different levels of importance for different votes (of the same type, i.e. time and required support), where size of quorum is a proxy for importance. However, given the current implementation, it would require multiple steps to change the  minAcceptQuorumPct  for a single vote (you'd have to change it, create a vote, and then change it back).  Implementing this could be done via an overload, storing the quorum percentage given on initialization as the default percentage.  forward()  should always use the default percentage.    In  struct Vote ,  startDate  and  executed  could be grouped together to save some storage  struct Vote 's  totalVoters  could be renamed to  totalPossible  to avoid confusion over whether it holds the total number of individual voters or total possible votes  canExecute()  should use  .add()  (l153):  uint256 totalVotes = vote.yea.add(vote.nay)  view  getters can be made  external  _isVoteOpen()  should cast up rather than down:  return now   uint256(vote.startDate).add(uint256(voteTime))   !vote.executed;  _isValuePct()  could be renamed to  _isAtLeastPct()  for clarity  _isValuePct()  should use  .mul()  (l268):  uint256 m = _total.mul(_pct)",

As a consequence, it's important to consider that 1% is actually represented by 10^16.\n\n\nMoreover you should pass to the smart contract the actual number, not the scientific notation so:\n- 10^16 \u00a0 is  10000000000000000 \u00a0 (or 1 with 16 zeros)\n- 10^18   is  1000000000000000000  (or 1 with 18 zeros)\n\n\nHere are a few percentages you can use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage\n\n\nScientific Notation\n\n\nactual input passed to the smart contract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0%\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1%\n\n\n10^16\n\n\n10000000000000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10%\n\n\n10*10^16\n\n\n100000000000000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20%\n\n\n20*10^16\n\n\n200000000000000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25%\n\n\n25*10^16\n\n\n250000000000000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50%\n\n\n50*10^16\n\n\n500000000000000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60%\n\n\n60*10^16\n\n\n600000000000000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n70%\n\n\n70*10^16\n\n\n700000000000000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n75%\n\n\n75*10^16\n\n\n750000000000000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100%\n\n\n100*10^16\n\n\n1000000000000000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVote lifecycle\n\n\nCreation\n\n\nvotingApp.newVote(bytes _executionScript, string _metadata)\n\n\n\n\n\nA new vote is initialized with:\n\n\n\n\nExecution script: \nEVM call script\n to be executed on vote approval, contains a series of addresses and calldata payloads that will be executed.\n\n\nMetadata: An arbitrary string that can be used to describe the voting.\n\n\n\n\nThe voting app conforms to the \naragonOS Forwarder interface\n. A generic forward action will create a vote with the provided execution script and empty metadata.\n\n\nWhen a vote is created a reference to the previous block number is saved as the snapshot block for the vote. The reason the previous block number is used is to avoid double voting in the same block the vote is created. Whenever a vote is casted, the MiniMeToken associated with the app is checked for the token balance of the voter at the snapshot block.\n\n\nCasting votes\n\n\nvotingApp.vote(uint256 _voteId, bool _supports)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order for casting a vote all these conditions must be met:\n\n\n\n\nSender had a positive token balance in the token at the vote snapshot block.\n\n\nVote hasn't expired.\n\n\nVote hasn't been already executed.\n\n\n\n\nIf the casted vote is in support of the vote, the number of tokens held by the sender at the snapshot block will be added to the vote \nyea\n counter. In case a vote is against, it will add it to the \nnay\n counter.\n\n\nAfter any casted votes, the contract checks whether a vote already has the complete support to be executed (even if everyone else voted against, the vote would still be approved), in that case the vote is executed and closed.\n\n\nExecuting voting\n\n\nvotingApp.executeVote(uint256 _voteId)\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a vote has expired time-wise (and no more votes are allowed), the result of the vote can be executed by anyone if it was approved. For a vote to be considered approved both conditions must be true:\n\n\n\n\nThe percentage of \nyea\n out of the total number of votes is greater than or equal the 'Support required' global parameter.\n\n\nyea\n support is greater than or equal the 'Minimum acceptance quorum' global parameter.\n\n\n\n\nChanging acceptance minimum quorum\n\n\nvotingApp.changeMinAcceptQuorumPct(uint256 _minAcceptQuorumPct)\n\n\n\n\n\nAt any time, the minimum acceptance quorum for the new votes can be modified.\n\n\nAny open votes will maintain the value minimum acceptance quorum was when they were created.\n\n\nForwarding\n\n\nForwarding\n using the common interface executes a \nvotingApp.newVote(...)\n action.

In order to remove the need of a trusted prices feed (oracle) for token exchange rate, every token is accounted on its own for budgeting and period financial statements.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nAccounting period\n\n\nAccounting periods are the equivalent of financial quarters in traditional organizations. Their length can be set depending on how the organization wants to use them.\n\n\nFor every accounting period, a balance (called token statement) for every transacted token is kept, this balance will be negative if more was spent than deposited and positive if otherwise.\n\n\nTransactions\n\n\nA transaction records an event in which assets were deposited or spent through the Finance app. Spend transactions are called 'outgoing transactions' and deposits 'incoming transactions'. Every transaction occurs in an accounting period and counts towards its token statement.\n\n\nTransactions cannot be created directly, they are recorded as the result of an operation (either a payment being executed or a deposit made).\n\n\nPayments\n\n\nPayments are the construct used for spending using the Finance app. A payment can be created to happen only once or it can be a recurring payment that will be performed according to a certain time schedule.\n\n\nIf executing a payment succeeds, it creates an outgoing transaction with a reference to the payment.\n\n\nBudgets\n\n\nBudgets give the ability to limit how much units of a token can be spent per Accounting period. Budgets are set in a token per token basis. By default no token has a budget, which means unlimited spending is allowed.\n\n\nOnce a budget has been set for a token, the Finance app will only allow the budgeted amount of tokens to be spent for that period.\n\n\nInitialization\n\n\nInitializing a Finance app requires the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\nVault:\n a reference to a \nVault\n instance that the Finance app will use for depositing and spending tokens. In order for it to work correctly, the Finance app \nmust have permissions to transfer Vault's tokens\n.\n\n\nEther token\n: address of the EtherToken instance used as ether.\n\n\nAccounting period duration\n: the initial duration for accounting periods.

The data passed as payload to transferAndCall is used directly as the reference for the deposit.\n\n\nGiven that aragonOS' EtherToken implementation conforms to ERC677, depositing Ether to the Finance app can be done by wrapping the ether using \netherToken.wrap()\n and then doing a \ntransferAndCall(...)\n or using the shortcut \nwrapAndCall(...)\n which performs both actions.\n\n\nPlease note that this section is subject to change as the \nERC677 discussion\n evolves.\n\n\nPayments\n\n\nDepending on the parameters a payment is created with, it can be an instant one time payment, a recurrent payment for payroll or a scheduled payment.\n\n\nCreating payment\n\n\nfinance.newPayment(...)\n\n\n\n\n\nA payment is created with the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\nToken\n: Address of token for payment.\n\n\nReceiver\n: Address that will receive payment.\n\n\nAmount\n: units of token that are payed every time the payment is due.\n\n\nInitial payment time\n: timestamp for when the first payment is done.\n\n\nInterval\n: number of seconds that need to pass between payment transactions.\n\n\nMaximum repeats\n: maximum instances a payment can be executed.\n\n\n\n\nIn case a payment can already be executed on creation, it will be executed.\n\n\nIf a payment is created that won't be repeated ever again, and already was executed, only an outgoing transaction is recorded to save storage.\n\n\nA payment can have a past \ninitial payment time\n, which could cause many instances of the recurring payment to be executed at payment creation time.\n\n\nExecuting payment\n\n\nfinance.executePayment(uint256 _paymentId)\nfinance.receiverExecutePayment(uint256 _paymentId)\n\n\n\n\n\nPayment execution will transfer the recipient of a payment the amount due depending on the current time. A single execution can result in multiple transactions if the payment hasn't been executed in time. To prevent it going out of gas when many transfers are due, a maximum amount of transfers are performed per execution (multiple executions could be needed in some instances).\n\n\nPayments can always be executed by its recipient, but there is also an additional role to the Finance app that allows another entity to execute the payment (recipient gets the funds in both instances).\n\n\nFor payments whose token is the known EtherToken, instead of doing a token transfer, it will directly transfer ether to the recipient.\n\n\nA payment execution can fail in case the organization is out of budget for the payment token for that particular accounting period, or the organization doesn't have enough token balance.\n\n\nDisabling payments\n\n\nfinance.setPaymentDisabled(uint256 _paymentId, bool _disabled)\n\n\n\n\n\nAt any time, a payment can be disabled by an authorized entity. If a payment hasn't been fully executed until that time and it is disabled, the recipient won't be able to execute it until it is enabled again.\n\n\nPeriods\n\n\nSetting duration\n\n\nfinance.setPeriodDuration(uint64 _periodDuration)\n\n\n\n\n\nSets the period duration for next periods. The current period duration cannot be modified.\n\n\nSetting budget\n\n\nfinance.setBudget(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount)\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdates the budget of a token for accounting periods. Newly set budget is automatically enforced for the current period.\n\n\nRemoving budget\n\n\nfinance.removeBudget(ERC20 _token)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoves budget for a token, allowing unlimited spending of that token in any period. Removing budget affects the current period.\n\n\nTransitioning periods\n\n\nfinance.tryTransitionAccountingPeriod(uint ttl)\n\n\n\n\n\nAll operations that can result in the creation of a transaction (creating a payment, executing a payment, performing a deposit) first check whether the accounting period needs to be transitioned (previous period has end time has passed) or it can be triggered manually by calling \ntryTransitionAccountingPeriod(...)\n.\n\n\nIf many periods passed (last operation occurred two periods ago, but never transitioned), an empty period is created for every one of them.\n\n\nTo prevent the case in which the Finance app cannot perform any operation because it needs to transition too many accounting periods, causing any operation to go out of gas, transitioning periods has a parameter for how many periods it will transition. Automatic transitions will only perform 10 transitions maximum, and if more were needed the operation will fail. In case this lock occurs and periods cannot be automatically transitioned, multiple period transitions operations can be triggered manually to remove the lockup.\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\n\n\nPayments are allowed to be created but can make it go out of budget. It can cause a race to execute payments right at the beginning of an Accounting period.\n\n\nPayment executions do not expire. There is an attack vector in which by not executing a payment in some time, a budget can be impacted when executed. In case this is happening, payment can be executed by another allowed entity or it could be disabled.",

These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q3 Transparency Report\n\n\nA recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q3 2017\n\n\n\n\nAs per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Pierre, Aragon\u2019s Frontend Developer\n\n\nI interviewed Pierre about how he came to work at Aragon, his thoughts on the future of Ethereum and tips for aspiring developers and teams\n\n\n\n\nAnother new member has joined the team! Pierre is a Frontend Developer that will help the team in fulfilling the Aragon vision. We talked about his experience as a software developer making beautiful user experiences, his thoughts on Ethereum, what tools he uses and what tips he has for aspiring developers and teams working in the space.\n\n\n\n\nOctober\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Luke, Aragon\u2019s Research Lead\n\n\nLuke and I talked about how he got involved with Ethereum and Aragon as well as what he sees that the future holds for them\n\n\n\n\nOur team has grown and gained a new member again! Today we\u2019re introducing Luke as a new addition. We discussed how he got into working on Ethereum and Aragon, what his vision of their future is and what he\u2019s most excited about getting to work on.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q3 Development Update\n\n\n\n\nThis quarter we have been hard at work developing the new \nv0.5 release\n. This release paves the way for Aragon to be an extendable governance tool which supports all possible use cases. It has required an immense amount of changes, including a re-architecturing called \naragonOS\n\n\n\n\nAragon Chat is now open\n\n\nAragon starts using the open source messaging platform Rocket Chat\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re happy to inform you that the migration to Rocket Chat is now complete.\nAll users and public channels have been migrated over to the new platform, so feel free to jump in and join the conversation!\nTo use the new Aragon Chat, you can connect directly via the web page or download one of the clients available for Rocket Chat and point it to https://aragon.chat\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing aragonOS: Say hi to modular and extendable organizations\n\n\nAragon\u2019s new exokernel-inspired architecture\n\n\n\n\naragonOS\n smart contract architecture is based on the idea of an organization being the aggregate of multiple components (called \napplications\n) and a pillar that is the \nKernel\n, which governs how these applications can talk to each other and how other entities can interact with them.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\n\n\nAragon will be Community Governed\n\n\nWhat community governance really entails\n\n\n\n\nSince the inception of the project, Aragon\u2019s vision has been to be open source software and to give power over it to the people who use it. The whole platform will be a community effort\u200a\u2014\u200aand it will take time to build it as envisioned.\n\n\nRight now we are a community based project and our long-term plan is to be a community governed project. To learn why this has been our vision for the project, where we are at the moment and how we plan on achieving our goals, let\u2019s take a look into the history and definition of these terms\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing Our Migration To An Open Source Messaging Platform\n\n\nAragon will migrate to Rocket Chat along with 10 other Ethereum projects\n\n\n\n\nToday we are announcing the plan of several Ethereum based projects to migrate to the open source messaging platform Rocket Chat.\n\n\nAragon will be migrating our community out of Slack and onto Rocket Chat in the next couple of weeks.\n\n\nThis has been a joint effort from the projects participating in the migration plan. Aragon initially started the proposal for the community after there had already been discussion on the subject from multiple projects. We came together as members of the same ecosystem and community to work on this plan to find an alternative that fit the needs of these cryptocurrency projects.\n\n\n\n\nAugust\n\n\nWhy Transparency Matters\n\n\nAragon Transparency Model and the unveiling of Aragon\u2019s new Transparency Framework\n\n\n\n\nAt Aragon, we feel obliged to show to our community\u200a\u2014\u200asupporters, contributors and token holders\u200a\u2014\u200athat we are being productive, effective and using the raised funds in a responsible manner.\n\n\nThe community is very important to us, they are the ones that we\u2019re building this project for. They support us, provide feedback and ideas on how we can all move forward while catering the needs of the users. In turn, we want to uphold our high transparency standards to keep the community up to date on what we are doing.\n\n\nThis is why we\u2019re showcasing our model for doing things transparently.\n\n\nThis all began with our Pre-Sale Transparency Report. And recently continued with the Token Buyback Transparency Report.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll now present you with all the different methods we\u2019re employing. The parts of our project\u2019s transparency model, starting with the new Transparency Framework.\n\n\n\n\nToken Buyback Transparency Report\n\n\nWhy did we buy back ANT and how we will disclose these events\n\n\n\n\nToday, adhering to our high transparency standards, we\u2019re ready to take the first step in our plan to extend our level of transparency\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is why we\u2019re reporting our token buybacks.\n\n\nIn our Intended Use of Revenue post we outlined the broad estimated allocation of our funds. As the development of our project has continued, we\u2019ve been able to narrow down some of the use cases of which we\u2019ll use our funds for.\n\n\n\n\nJuly\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Oliver, Aragon\u2019s Senior Full Stack Web3 Engineer\n\n\nOliver and I discussed how he got started with Ethereum, how he came to work at Aragon and where he sees the project going\n\n\n\n\nWe have a new addition to our Dev Team! Today we\u2019re introducing Oliver as a new team member. He expresses his views on Ethereum, his favourite projects and how we can all make Aragon better together.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Network Jurisdiction Part 1: Decentralized Court\n\n\n\n\nWhen first designing Aragon, the goal was to have organizations run entirely trustless. Thus, we created a platform to create organizations governed by trustless and immutable code. Now, when we say that these organizations run in a trustless manner, we\u2019re talking about how to describe the laws under which the code runs. Code is trustless when deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It won\u2019t change at the whim of a person, it will run as designed, following the logic set forth in it.\n\n\nYet, it was clear that we can\u2019t account for every possible circumstance in our code. Even if you manage to encode tons of variables into the code, there are things you cannot possibly encode because the blockchain isn\u2019t aware about the physical world. And often, in the case of disputes, things are subjective and up to interpretation.\n\n\nOur solution to this problem is the Aragon Network Jurisdiction. A decentralized jurisdiction to solve subjective disputes as an Aragon Network service.\n\n\n\n\nThe emergent Ethereum stack\n\n\ndistrict0x, the first manifestation of the Ethereum + Aragon stack\n\n\n\n\nSoftware allows us to abstract away from existing functionality to focus on building.\n\n\nAt Aragon, we use Ethereum. Ethereum provides us the consensus layer to establish truth. And the ability to create smart contracts that are self-enforcing.\n\n\nSo, generally speaking, we don\u2019t have to worry about Ethereum. We use Ethereum, driving usage to the platform, thus increasing its value. So we\u2019re indirectly funding its further development.\n\n\nThat\u2019s the virtuous circle that tokenization makes possible.\n\n\n\n\nAragon\u2019s Community Governance Model\n\n\nHow we plan to achieve transparency and inclusion for the community\n\n\n\n\nOur community is everything for us. With Aragon, we want a thousand communities to flourish. Tokens align the incentives of communities and projects towards the same goals and values. But those communities are the center of where the magic happens.\n\n\nTwo weeks ago we posted our Community Governance Model for feedback from the community. We received some comments on it, and we now have the final version of the model ready. Before this, we had already worked on the model internally. I drafted the original version and Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo provided their thoughts on it.\n\n\nFurther changes might be made as things develop. But we wanted to show the community what we\u2019ll be doing in terms of governance, transparency and inclusion.\n\n\nThe model was designed so that every community member will be treated equally. Everyone will have the same changes of participation, and our Meetings and decisions to be transparent.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Mihai Alisie as an Advisor\n\n\nWhy him, why now and the road ahead\n\n\n\n\nWe announced two of our Advisors before the successful ANT sale. Kenny Rowe from the MakerDAO project and Jake Brukhman of CoinFund. Both experts in their fields and respected members of the Ethereum community.\n\n\nWhile we did have our Board of Advisors in place before the token sale, we chose not to disclose all the members then.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q2 Development Update\n\n\nv0.4 release status and the road ahead\n\n\n\n\nWe will be delivering regular updates on the development of Aragon. This is our first quarterly update to bring the community up to speed on where we\u2019re at and the road ahead.\n\n\n\n\nJune\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Mar\u00eda, Aragon\u2019s Head of Strategy and Operations\n\n\nMar\u00eda shares her thoughts about Aragon and what got her into working on an Ethereum based project\n\n\n\n\nAs a continuation on our team interview series, I interviewed Mar\u00eda\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Head of Strategy and Operations\u200a\u2014\u200ato learn more about her, her interest in Ethereum, how she came to work, and her role, at Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nAragon to power the district0x Network\n\n\nWelcoming district0x to the Aragon Network Jurisdiction\n\n\n\n\nToday, we are pleased to introduce the first resident of the Aragon Network Jurisdiction, the district0x Network\n\n\nThe district0x Network is a collective of decentralized marketplaces and communities powered by Ethereum, Aragon, and IPFS. Markets on the network, also referred to as districts, are all built upon a shared framework comprised of smart contracts and front-end libraries which provide the functionality necessary to operate communal marketplaces which are similar to services like AirBNB, eBay, Uber, or Reddit with payments.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Harsh, Aragon\u2019s Product Engineer\n\n\nHarsh talks about how he came to work on a Ethereum project and where he sees Aragon going in the future\n\n\n\n\nAs a continuation on our team interview series, I interviewed Harsh\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Product Engineer\u2014 to learn more about him, his past ventures, how he came to work on Aragon, and his future vision for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nAragon partners with 0x\n\n\nMaking decentralized organizations go beyond Ether\n\n\n\n\nSo today, we\u2019re excited to announce that we\u2019re partnering with 0x to allow Aragon organizations to accept and operate with any token. 0x is a protocol for decentralized exchange on Ethereum allowing users to exchange tokens without a central broker\u200a\u2014\u200aending the many inefficiencies of centralization by enabling transparent token exchanges between contracts.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Tatu, Aragon\u2019s Community Lead\n\n\nTatu talks about why he is part of the Ethereum community and why he is so enthusiastic about Aragon and decentralization\n\n\n\n\nAs part of our team interview series (Luis\u2019 Interview|Jorge\u2019s Interview), I\u2019ve interviewed Tatu\u2014 Aragon\u2019s Community Lead\u200a\u2014\u200ato learn more about his experience in the Ethereum ecosystem, the projects he\u2019s most excited about, and why he chose to work for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nMay\n\n\nAnnouncing the ENS Aragon Network Company Registry\n\n\n\n\nWith Aragon, we set out to create software that makes it easy to create and run decentralized organizations. However, meaningless ETH addresses made sending funds and completing transactions for operating a business unnecessarily complicated.\n\n\nFortunately, ENS (Ethereum Name Service) recently solved this issue by enabling the assignment of human-readable names to eth addresses. This was important for the entire Ethereum ecosystem (including Aragon)\u2014 no longer do you have to send transactions to a series of numbers and letters.\n\n\nSo today, we\u2019re excited to announce that we won the bid for the name company.eth! In this post, we\u2019ll explain how Aragon organizations will use the name and the implications for Aragon Network user-adoption.\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Token Sale: The Numbers\n\n\nRoughly $25 million was collected in 26 minutes. The rate was $122k/s the first 3 blocks.\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, we closed the 4th largest crowdfunding event in history, and the 2nd largest in the blockchain space (after The DAO). Raising 275,000 ether, or roughly $25 million, we\u2019re incredibly humbled by the support of the community and the trust in our mission to make decentralized autonomous organizations widespread.\n\n\nIn this post, we\u2019d like to reflect on the last 48 hours, provide some data on the sale, and most importantly express our gratitude to the community.\n\n\n\n\nFinal token sale recap\n\n\n\n\nPlease read How to Securely Participate in the sale for information and tutorials on how to participate.\n\n\n\n\nPre-Sale Transparency Report\n\n\n\n\nBefore tomorrow\u2019s token sale, we believe it\u2019s important that we release a transparency report about the pre-sale. This post will provide you with details on who purchased ANT before the token sale, the terms of the sale, the total Ether received, and how those funds were used.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Token Sale Contracts Have Been Deployed and Activated\n\n\nANT sale begins on Ethereum mainnet\u2019s block 3,723,000\u200a\u2014\u200aMay 17, ~6pm GMT\n\n\n\n\nHow to Participate in the Sale\n\n\n\n\nWait for block 3,723,000 (May 17 at approximately 6pm GMT). You can check what the latest block is on Etherscan. After block 3,722,999 has been mined, it is safe to send the transaction. Note that sending the transaction before that block is mined will result in a loss of fees.\n\n\nSend ETH to the address posted on https://aragon.network\n\n\nSend at least 200,000 gas with your transaction.\n\n\nIf your contribution is accepted, tokens will be transferred to your address in the same transaction. However, tokens will not be transferable until the sale is finalized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the Aragon Community Multisig\n\n\nA 3/5 multisig that will approve the deployment of the Aragon Network\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Network Token (ANT) will initially begin as an upgradable token, but will evolve to serve as the governance token for the Aragon Network when deployed.\n\n\nWe estimate that the Aragon Network will be deployed in May of 2018. Prior to deployment and transition to a governance token, we plan to perform numerous audits and bug bounties to ensure thorough testing and to mitigate the risk of another DAO hack.\n\n\nHowever, the actual ANT token will be first distributed in 2 days. So this raises the question: how do we plan to upgrade the token\u2019s functionality to a governance token?\n\n\n\n\nToken sale cap clarification\n\n\ntl;dr: Our cap is not $100m, or near that amount\n\n\n\n\nWe have had a lot of questions about our hidden cap mechanism.\n\n\nSince it\u2019s pretty new to the token sale world, we understand the confusion and want to provide a simple breakdown to clarify.\n\n\n\n\nToken Sale Audit Results\n\n\nNo Critical Issues Reported and Token Sale is On-Schedule\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure a stable and safe token sale, we employed the help of Jordi Baylina and Piper Merriam to perform independent audits of Aragon token sale contract code. Jordi and Piper completed their reports this week and published their independent findings (Jordi\u2019s Report | Piper\u2019s Report). No critical issues were reported in either independent audit. And for the issues that were found, we\u2019ve worked closely with Jordi and Piper to resolve them and improve the code.\n\n\nIn addition, we\u2019re happy to announce that there have been no critical issues reported through the bug bounty program. Thanks to all of those that have participated, and note that the bug bounty program will continue indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing the Aragon Advisors\n\n\nKenny from MakerDAO and Jake from CoinFund will be advising Aragon\n\n\n\n\nWe are pleased to announce two people that we really admire in the Ethereum community will be joining us as advis0rs: Kenny Rowe and Jake Brukhman.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Sourcing Aragon\n\n\nMaking Aragon Code Accessible and Providing Documentation Soon\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was 12, I got my first laptop\u200a\u2014\u200aa piece of junk with only 256MB of RAM. It was slow and literally falling apart. But this didn\u2019t stop me from developing. Using Linux, I had the latest available software. And thanks to thousands of developers around the world, I could examine different pieces of code and learn programming.\n\n\nThe free software and open source phenomena has not only made the world a more inclusive place, but it has also increased the speed of software development\u200a\u2014\u200aby sharing, developers no longer need to reinvent the wheel. For example, we didn\u2019t have to build the native app wrapper or the Ethereum wallet for Aragon.\n\n\nSo when we find something that we can give back to the community, we make a point of doing so. We\u2019ve found that by sharing code, others can learn from it (like I did as a teenager) and people will find ways to improve it.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Securely Participate in the Aragon Token Sale\n\n\nUsing Mist, Parity, My Ether Wallet, and Metamask\n\n\n\n\nThe ANT token sale is happening on May 17th! In anticipation, we\u2019ve been and will continue to frequently post about Aragon and sale details. In this post, we list the sources to trust for ANT sale information, and provide instructions for purchasing with Mist, Parity, My Ether Wallet, and Metamask.\n\n\n\n\nAragon On Tour: Meetups Around the Globe\n\n\nCome to one of our meetups, have a beer with us and talk decentralized awesomeness\n\n\n\n\nOn the Internet, nobody knows you\u2019re a dog. This has been extremely beneficial for the development of communities around the world, and crypto is perhaps one of the most remarkable examples.\n\n\nBut who doesn\u2019t like to have a beer with people that share common interests? It\u2019s part of our human nature!\n\n\nSo aside from being on Slack all day and night, we\u2019ve organized a series of meetups for Ethereum \n Aragon enthusiasts to get together to talk about exciting projects and have a few drinks!\n\n\n\n\nAragon Tutorial: Raising funds with a token\n\n\nHow you can raise capital creating your own token in a few clicks\n\n\n\n\nToken sales are changing the rules of the game, making it extremely easy for anyone in the world to gather capital and build new products.\n\n\nWith Aragon, you can create token sales in a few clicks and publish the sale address so everyone can participate.\n\n\n\n\nOur Public Product Roadmap and Issue Reporting\n\n\nEnhancing transparency in product development\n\n\n\n\nOften, product and software development is secretive and confidential until the official product launch. While this has the effect of building excitement, it can lead to unrealistic user expectations, development of products that are missing key features, and ultimately products that miss end-user needs.\n\n\nAs a result, we believe it\u2019s important to engage the community throughout the product development process\u200a\u2014\u200aand this is what we\u2019ve done while developing Aragon. The community has consistently provided valuable feedback and unique perspectives. From user interface design to our token model, feedback from the Aragon community has guided Aragon Core and Network development.\n\n\n\n\nAragon token sale bug bounty\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited to announce that we are conducting a bug bounty in advance of the Aragon Network Token sale. We believe bug bounties are essential to ensuring a safe release, and are especially important when cryptocurrency is being exchanged. This post will provide more details on our bug bounty program scope, the timeline, and compensation.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Tutorial: Tokens and voting\n\n\nHow you can easily create your own token and govern your organization with it\n\n\n\n\nFrom the beginning, we wanted Aragon to be a tool that anyone can use. So we put a lot of thought into making things easy.\n\n\nTo make things even easier, we are starting a series of short videos that explain every part of Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nOur Intended Use of Revenue\n\n\nHow we plan to use the token sale to drive development\n\n\n\n\nAs previously announced, the Aragon Network Token (ANT) sale will be conducted on May 17th. The funds raised will fund Aragon Core development and the Network deployment.\n\n\nThe specific steps and timeline to make Aragon production ready are outlined in our development plan, released last week. In this post, we\u2019re excited to provide details on our intended use of revenue from the token sale.\n\n\n\n\nApril\n\n\nAragon + Status: Bringing decentralized organizations everywhere\n\n\nGetting ready to offer Aragon to 2.3bn smartphone users\n\n\n\n\nOur mission at Aragon is to make decentralized organizations widespread.\n\n\nTo achieve our mission, we built a dApp to easily create and operate decentralized organizations on Ethereum. First, we focused on building a feature rich web and desktop (including MacOS, Linux, and Windows) application.\n\n\nBut our initial focus ignored a major way that over 2.3 billion people interact with applications today: their smartphones. The reason we ignored these users was simple\u200a\u2014\u200athe development effort to create mobile applications is significant and would distract from developing fully featured web and desktop versions.\n\n\n\n\nA note for exchanges or holders interacting with ANT in an automated manner\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Network Token has vesting built in that limits the transferability of the token until a specified time.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Token Sale Technical Overview\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: ANT is a MiniMe Token with built-in vesting functionality. Two security audits are currently being performed and a bug bounty will begin soon. ANT contract code is live on Github.\n\n\nThis post will discuss the ANT base token and its functionality, the ANT sale contract, and the current state of ANT security and future efforts to ensure a successful token sale.\n\n\n\n\nThe path to mainstream decentralized organizations\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, we published our development plan for Aragon Core and the Aragon Network. This post explains in greater detail our structure to store and allocate funds from Aragon Network Token (ANT) sales, features of the next Aragon Core release, and plans to deploy the Aragon Network and its first organizations.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the Aragon Development Plan\n\n\nThe road ahead to make decentralized organizations widespread\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we announced our token sale and its terms.\n\n\nToday, we will be addressing the future of Aragon, by releasing our Development Plan.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Network Token sale terms\n\n\nFounder vesting, simple pricing and distribution\n\n\n\n\nYesterday we announced the Aragon Network Token sale. Today, we will go into its details. For a simple overview of the sale in just one page, download the one pager.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing the Aragon Network Token sale\n\n\nANT sale starts on May 17th. Bootstrapping the creation of the world\u2019s first digital jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\nWe have been asked countless times about whether we would do a token sale or not. Our answer always was: if it makes sense, we will!\n\n\nAfter launching Aragon, we spent a lot of time talking to people and thinking. What will be the main issues to make decentralized organizations widespread?\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Luis, Aragon\u2019s Project Lead\n\n\nLuis talks about why he is creating Aragon and his long-term vision for it\n\n\n\n\nI have interviewed my cofounder Luis\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Project Lead\u200a\u2014\u200aand asked him about the future of the project, and his long term vision.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the Aragon Network\n\n\nSolving the biggest hurdles to make decentralized organizations widespread\n\n\n\n\nOur first step was to develop an extremely easy to use product on top of the Ethereum blockchain that lets everyone run decentralized organizations. Now we have validated the concept, the market interest and most importantly, the main hurdles to realize our vision.\n\n\nThose main hurdles to make decentralized organizations widespread are upgradeability and decentralized arbitration.\n\n\n\n\nThe 8 pillars of any organization\n\n\nA walk-through of Aragon and the why behind each feature\n\n\n\n\nWhen we set out to create Aragon, we researched what were the core features that an organization needs.\n\n\nLast year, the 11th of November, we came up with the first version of the product full spec. Most of the features that you see today in Aragon, as well as how they are structured, were laid out that month.\n\n\nSince we have been asked a few times which was our thought process to came up with that features, I\u2019ll go through it.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Jorge, Aragon\u2019s Tech Lead\n\n\nJorge talks about what excites him the most about Aragon, and the road ahead\n\n\n\n\nI have interviewed my cofounder Jorge\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Tech Lead\u200a\u2014\u200aand asked him about the Ethereum community, his workspace and the road ahead.\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized organizations can solve the world\u2019s worst problems\n\n\nDisintermediating human trade\u200a\u2014\u200abusiness\u200a\u2014\u200ais the first step towards a more fair world\n\n\n\n\nWe take most power for granted. After all, humans enforce most of their social contracts by giving away some freedom.\n\n\nWe usually think about intermediaries in a microscopic scale. We think about the guy who delivered us a package. Or the agency we hired to find us a buyer for an apartment.\n\n\nYet those intermediaries are insignificant compared to the macro-scale intermediaries.\n\n\n\n\nMarch\n\n\nThe Governance Release, Alpha 0.3 \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\n\n\nBring your token, new bylaws, web version and more\n\n\n\n\nTokens are changing the rules of the game. We don\u2019t need to think about obscure business models anymore. We can align our users\u2019 incentives with ours and release a token that implements that logic.\n\n\nAt Aragon we believe that we are at the dawn of this token model.\n\n\nAnd we want to help the community in this journey.\n\n\nSo today, we are introducing ERC20 token support for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nReleasing Aragon Alpha \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n\nOne month ago, we introduced our vision of how companies and organizations will work. And we set to make it a reality.  \n\n\nToday, I want to personally thank all the community for the warmest welcome we could have ever dreamed of for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Solidity code deployment techniques\n\n\n\n\nThis is a continuation post to the work we did with Zeppelin for the article on Proxy libraries for code upgradeability. Reading that post is not required in order to understand this one, but it is definitely a recommended read, as the ideas are pretty much on the same line. And towards the end we will combine them.\n\n\n\n\nElectron + MetaMask = Secure, Easy to Use Dapps \ud83d\udd12\n\n\nSandboxing Ethereum DApps with Electron\n\n\n\n\nWhen we chose what would be our main build target for Aragon, our priorities for choosing Electron + MetaMask were security and usability.  \n\n\nOf course Aragon also runs on any Web3 environment (like Mist, Parity, Chrome with MetaMask\u2026) but we wanted to have a build target in which we have full control over the user experience.  \n\n\nSince we got part of the community intrigued on how our implementation works, this post hopes to explain our decisions and the challenges we found.\n\n\n\n\nHow Aragon approaches identity and the Ethereum Keybase Resolver\n\n\n\n\nIdentity is one of the most important parts when developing decentralized applications. This is specially true for Aragon, where identity is needed to know who are you doing business with or who are the people that will manage the money you are investing.\n\n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n\nLibrary Driven Development in Solidity\n\n\n\n\nA comprehensive review on how to develop more modular, reusable and elegant smart contract systems on top of the Ethereum Virtual Machine by using libraries\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Aragon: Unstoppable companies\n\n\n\n\nToday, taking a stand to help this fight, we are introducing Aragon.\n\nAragon is everything you need to operate your company or organizational structure, on Ethereum.\n\nAragon lets everyone create value without borders or intermediaries.\n\nCap table, vesting, payments, voting, bylaws, fundraising and identity all in a beautiful, unified interface.",

Code is trustless when deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It won\u2019t change at the whim of a person, it will run as designed, following the logic set forth in it.  Yet, it was clear that we can\u2019t account for every possible circumstance in our code. Even if you manage to encode tons of variables into the code, there are things you cannot possibly encode because the blockchain isn\u2019t aware about the physical world.

The Aragon project is currently working on AragonOS, which introduces some major changes to smart contracts as we know them today. More specifically, smart contracts\u2019 underlying architecture is in dire need of some upgrades. Introducing more flexibility and making it easier to extend the functionality of these contracts is well worth looking into.\n\n\n\n\nVenturebeat\n\n\nNo CEO needed: These blockchain platforms will let \u2018the crowd\u2019 run startups\n\n\n\n\nBack in May, I wrote about the concept of DAOs, decentralized autonomous organizations capable of running themselves thanks to blockchain technology \u2014 no CEO or C-Suite needed. At the time I was writing, there were a few people in the blockchain community testing out the idea but no strong efforts underway. That was six months ago.\n\n\nAs anyone in the crypto space will tell you, six months is a really long time.

CryptoEagles enhances the Ethereum ecosystem by creating thousands of transactions that will totally collapse it, and it also enhances the Aragon ecosystem by having cute eagles everywhere, some of them which would really resemble Aragon s logo.\n\n\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. An [ERC721](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/721)-compatible token interface to represent non-fungible resources (the eagles)\n2. A set of AragonOS-compatible smart contracts to feed them with multiple tokens, with the contracts burning them afterwards\n3. A web interface to let users interact with the eagles, collect and trade them as they see fit\n\n\n\n## Grant size\n\nFunding: Up to $100k in ETH, split into chunks paid out over achieved deliverables.\n\nSuccess reward: Up to $50k in ANT, given out when all deliverables are ready.\n\n\n## Application requirements\n\n- Proof of concept of the smart contracts for the ERC721-compatible token. Alternatively, a whitepaper researching the implementation of the whole protocol\n- Details of the team members, alongside with their willingness in terms of implication\n- Estimated average burn rate for completing the deliverables\n- Legal structure to be adopted, if any\n\n\n\n## Development timeline\n\nThe development timeline will be the following one in regards to each deliverable:\n\n1. Jan 2018\n2. Feb 2018\n3. Apr 2018\n\nTestnet launch will be expected during March 2018, with mainnet launch being June 2018",

            "text": "aragonOS\n\n\nRefleja la implememtaci\u00f3n \naragonOS\n 2.0.1. Actualizado el 4 de Diciembre de 2017.\n\n\nUna arquitectura inspirada en \nexokernels\n, para DAOs modulares, actualizables y seguras.\n\n\n\nIntroducci\u00f3n\n\n\nEsta arquitectura inspirada en exokernels habilita la creaci\u00f3n de Organizaciones Aut\u00f3nomas Descentralizadas (del ingl\u00e9s, DAOs). Implementa un sistema de permisos inspirados en UNIX con contratos inteligentes que permiten un contol seguro y eficiente de los recursos software.\n\n\nLos contratos inteligentes pueden definir las reglas y sanciones alrededor de un acuerdo. Tambi\u00e9n pueden tomar decisiones as\u00ed como reforzar compromisos previos. Por ejemplo la habilidad de transferir grandes cantidades de fondos. Pero esta gran responsabilidad tambi\u00e9n hace de los contratos inteligentes el primer objetivo de ataque. Los contratos inteligentes son esenciales para el ecosistema Ethereum. Testarlos y certificarlos no compone una soluci\u00f3n absoluta ya que, invevitablemente, los humanos cometen errores.\n\n\nEntonces, \u00bfc\u00f3mo podemos garantizar que las DAOs funcionan de forma eficiente y segura? Y, \u00bfcon capacidades de actualizaci\u00f3n, manteniendo la seguridad y la evoluci\u00f3n del ecosistema Ethereum?\n\n\nPresentamos nuestro sistema operativo seguro y descentralizado: \naragonOS\n.\n\n\nEste documento provee una revisi\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica acerca de su arquitectura. Para una introducci\u00f3n menos t\u00e9cnica orientada a aragonOS puedes revisar el \nannouncement blogpost\n.\n\n\n1. Kernel y Lista de Control de Acceso\n\n\nLa \nLista de Control de Acceso\n (del ingl\u00e9s, ACL) es el filtro que determina si una direcci\u00f3n tiene un cierto rol en el contexto de una aplicaci\u00f3n. Permite o proh\u00edbe la ejecuci\u00f3n de acciones en un contexto dado, tales como actualizaciones, as\u00ed como las determinaci\u00f3n de las entidades con poder sobre dicho permiso.\n\n\nEl sistema de permisos de la ACL est\u00e1 inspirado en UNIX. Las ACLs controlan los permisos otorgados a un usuario y pueden facilitar la transferencia de los permisos mencionados. De manera similar al comando \nsudo\n en UNIX, los usuarios pueden escalar permisos, pero con m\u00e1s flexibilidad y granularidad.\n\n\nAplicaciones\n\n\nLas \nAplicaciones\n son contratos inteligentes que dependen del Kernel\u2014el kernel del sistema operativo\u2014para su propia ACL y actualizar su c\u00f3digo. Ya que las aplicaciones son actualizables, podemos esperar que existan por un largo per\u00edodo de tiempo. Esto significa que es seguro para una aplicaci\u00f3n ser responsable de la posesi\u00f3n de distintos activos en nombre de la DAO (p.ej. tokens y nombre ENS). Las aplicaciones pueden implementar m\u00faltiples acciones y estas acciones pueden estar protegidas o no por la ACL. En caso de que una acci\u00f3n est\u00e9 protegida, la ejecuci\u00f3n de la acci\u00f3n s\u00f3lo se permitir\u00e1 cuando lo autorice la ACL.\n\n\nRoles\n\n\nOtra caracter\u00edstica para garantizar la seguridad en el ecosistema es la posibilidad de delegaci\u00f3n de responsabilidades para la ejecuci\u00f3n aut\u00f3noma. Las Aplicaciones pueden definir un n\u00famero determinado de roles y los roles pueden agrupar una o m\u00e1s acciones detr\u00e1s. Para realizar una acci\u00f3n protegida por la ACL, la entidad que desee realizarla deber\u00e1 disopner de los permisos necesarios para ejecutar las acciones de ese rol.\n\n\nLos Roles son siempre \u00fanicos para cada aplicaci\u00f3n. Disponer de un rol en una aplicaci\u00f3n no garantiza el permiso para la posesi\u00f3n del mismo rol en otras aplicaciones. Una entidad puede tener muchos roles en una aplicaci\u00f3n.\n\n\nEjemplo:\n\n\ncontract TokenApp is App {\n    bytes32 constant public MINT_ROLE = 0x1234;\n    function mint(address _receiver, uint256 _amount) auth(MINT_ROLE) { \u2026 }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEntidad\n\n\nUna Entidad es cualquier actor que est\u00e9 representado por una direcci\u00f3n Ethereum, como una multisig (una cuenta que necesita m\u00faltiples firmas antes de ejecutar una acci\u00f3n), una aplicaci\u00f3n (por ejemplo, una aplicaci\u00f3n para votaciones que solo ejecuta una acci\u00f3n si los poseedores de los tokens votan favorablemente), o una simplre cuenta controlada por una clave privada.\n\n\nEl sistema puede delegar permisos a grupos de entidades mediante la implementaci\u00f3n de un Grupo de Aplicaci\u00f3n. Como en otras aplicaciones, puede depender de la ACL para la protecci\u00f3n de funciones importantes, tales como a\u00f1adir o borrar miembros de un grupo. Cuando los miembros de un grupo quieren ejecutar una acci\u00f3n espec\u00edfica, el Grupo de Aplicaci\u00f3n act\u00faa como un contrato proxy que realiza la acci\u00f3n en nombre del grupo.\n\n\nPermisos\n\n\nUn \nPermiso\n est\u00e1 definido como la habilidad de realizar acciones (agrupadas en un rol) en determinadas instancias de una aplicaci\u00f3n (identificadas por su direcci\u00f3n).\n\n\nNos refererimos como \nInstancia de un permiso\n a si una entidad tiene o no un cierto \nPermiso\n.\n\n\nCuando un permiso se crea, un \nGestor de Permisos\n se establece para ese permiso espec\u00edfico. El gestor de permisos puede conceder o revocar instancias de permisos para ese permiso.\n\n\nCrear Permiso\n\n\nkernel.createPermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role, address manager)\n\n\n\n\n\ncreatePermission\n fallar\u00e1 si esa instancia de permiso para ese permiso ya ha sido creada antes.\n\n\nEsta llamada es id\u00e9ntica a \ngrantPermission\nexcepto porque permite la creaci\u00f3n de un nuevo permiso desde cero si el mismo todav\u00eda no existe.\n\n\nLa acci\u00f3n \ncreatePermission\n necesita ser protegida por la ACL con un rol. Se trata de una funci\u00f3n importante que puede ser usada de manera maliciosa. Cuando el Kernel est\u00e1 inicializado, crea el permiso para una direcci\u00f3n que a su vez puede crear nuevos permisos.\n\n\nSi se comprueba en la ACL que un permiso que no ha sido creado antes, la ACL no permitir\u00e1 por defecto que la acci\u00f3n sea realizada.\n\n\nConceder Permiso\n\n\nkernel.grantPermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role)\n\n\n\n\n\nLa \nentidad\n podr\u00eda estar habilitada para llamar todas las acciones que su \nrol\n pueda realizar en esa \napp\n particular. Esto tendr\u00eda efecto hasta que el gestor de permisos lo revocase llamando \nrevokePermission\n.\n\n\nLa acci\u00f3n \ngrantPermission\n no requiere protecci\u00f3n con la ACL porque una entidad solo puede hacer cambios a un permiso si es el \nmanager\n para un permiso dado.\n\n\nRevocar Permiso\n\n\nkernel.revokePermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role)\n\n\n\n\n\nrevokePermission\n puede ser llamada en cualquier momento por el \nmanager\nde un cierto permiso y borrar\u00e1 la habilidad de una \nentidad\n de tener un \nrol\n en una \napp\n.\n\n\nLa acci\u00f3n \nrevokePermission\n tampoco necesita ser protegida por la ACL, ya que una entidad tan solo puede realizar cambios si es el \nmanager\n para un permiso dado.\n\n\ncreatePermission\n, \ngrantPermission\n y \nrevokePermission\n disparan el mismo evento que los clientes de Aragon deben registrar y usar para construir una versi\u00f3n local del ACL.\n\n\nSetPermission(address indexed from, bytes32 indexed role, address indexed to, bool allowed)\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablecer el Gestor de Permisos\n\n\nkernel.setPermissionManager(address newManager, address app, bytes32 role)\n\n\n\n\n\nSolo el gestor de permisos de un permiso puede llamar a esta funci\u00f3n para establecer un nuevo gestor.\n\n\nEstablecer un nuevo gestor de permisos resulta en la p\u00e9rdida de poder de gesti\u00f3n para el gestor de permisos antiguo para ese permiso.\n\n\ncreatePermission\n ejecuta un caso especial de establecer el gestor de permisos por primera vez. Desde este punto en adelante, el gestor solo puede ser cambiado con \nsetPermissionManager\n.\n\n\nCambiar el gestor de permisos dispara el siguiente evento:\n\n\nChangePermissionManager(address indexed app, bytes32 indexed role, address indexed manager)\n\n\n\n\n\nEjemplo\n\n\nComo un ejemplo, los siguientes pasos muestran el flujo completo para un usuario Root que crea una nueva DAO con los permisos b\u00e1sicos de manera que una Voting app pueda gestionar los fondos almacenados en una Vault app:\n\n\n\n\nDesplegar el Kernel.\n\n\nEjecutando \nkernel.initialize(rootAddress)\n se crea el permiso:\n\ncreatePermission(rootAddress, kernelAddress, PERMISSIONS_CREATOR_ROLE, rootAddress)\n\n\nDesplegar la Voting app\n\n\nConceder a la Voting app la habilitad de llamar \ncreatePermission\n:\n\ngrantPermission(votingAppAddress, PERMISSIONS_CREATOR_ROLE, kernelAddress)\n (debe ser ejecutada por una \nrootAddress\n)\n\n\nDesplegar la Vault app, que tiene una firma llamada \ntransferTokens\n\n\nCrear un nuevo voto v\u00eda la Voting app para crear el permiso \nTRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE\n mediante:\n\ncreatePermission(votingAppAddress, vaultAppAddress, TRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE, votingAppAddress)\n\n\nSi el voto es aprobado, la Voting app tiene acceso a todas las acciones del \nTRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE\n, que en este caso es simplemente \ntransferTokens\n en el Vault.\n\n\nLos votos pueden ser creados para transferir fondos.\n\n\nLa Voting app podr\u00e1 revocar o re-conceder el permiso ya que es el gestor de permisos para \nTRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE\n en \nvaultAppAddress\n.\n\n\n\n\nUna implementaci\u00f3n de la ACL explicada puede encontrarse en el archivo \naragonOS\u2019s Kernel\n.\n\n\nComprobar permisos\n\n\nLas Aplicaciones pueden decidir si protegen acciones detr\u00e1s de la ACL o no, ya que tiene sentido que algunas acciones sean completamente p\u00fablicas. La protecci\u00f3n de una acci\u00f3n detr\u00e1s de la ACL se hace simplemente a\u00f1adiendo el modificador de autenticaci\u00f3n que pasa el rol requerido para realizar la acci\u00f3n como un par\u00e1metro. El modificador auth comprobar\u00e1 con el Kernel si la entidad realizando la llamada tiene ese rol o no.\n\n\nEscalar Permisos\n\n\nConsideremos un kernel \nK\n, una entidad \nE\n0\n y una aplicaci\u00f3n \nA\n. \nE\n quiere realizar una cci\u00f3n \nA\nsig\n en la aplicaci\u00f3n \nA\n. El cliente sabe (ya que es parte de los metadatos de la aplicaci\u00f3n) que para realizar \nA\nsig\n se requiere que una entidad tenga \nA\nrole\n.\nEl cliente deber\u00eda saber que \nE\n0\n no puede llamar directamente \nA\nsig\n, ya que no tiene ese rol, pero una lista de Entidades [\nE\n1\n, \nE\n2\n] s\u00ed que tienen ese rol en la aplicaci\u00f3n \nA\n. El cliente deber\u00eda entonces mostrar al usuario las m\u00faltiples rutas de reenv\u00edo posibles para pasar la llamada a \nE\n1\n, de manera que \nE\n0\n pueda realizar \nA\nsig\n.\n\n\nEl c\u00e1lculo de una ruta de reenv\u00edo requiere saber a trav\u00e9s de qu\u00e9 entidad Forwarders \nE\n0\n puede realizar acciones.\nEl usuario o contrato que realice esta acci\u00f3n podr\u00eda entonces elegir su ruta preferida para reenviar permisos para realizar \nA\nsig\n. Por ejemplo, \nE\n1\n puede ser una Voting app \nV\n, as\u00ed que la acci\u00f3n ser\u00eda crear un nuevo voto que, en caso de ser aprobado, llamar\u00eda \nA\nsig\n. Como \nV\n tiene un rol \nA\nrole\n tiene el permiso de ejecutar \nA\nsig\n, entonces tendr\u00edamos un escalado de permisos completado satisfactoriamente.\nN\u00f3tese que el escalado de permisos puede ocurrir instant\u00e1neamente o puede retrasarse y requerir acciones por parte de otras entidades como en el caso de la voting app.\n\n\n\n\nForwarders\n\n\nPara hacer el escalado de permisos m\u00e1s sencillo, se define una interfaz com\u00fan para que suceda:\n\n\ncontract Forwarder {\n   bool isForwarder = true;\n   function canForward(address sender, bytes evmCallScript) view returns (bool);\n   function forward(bytes evmCallScript);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEVM Call Script\n\n\nEl par\u00e1metro \nevmCallScript\n permite la ejecuci\u00f3n de m\u00faltiples llamadas con simplemente una transacci\u00f3n. Esto es \u00fatil, por ejemplo, en el caso de votaciones, ya que permite la aprobaci\u00f3n de m\u00faltiples acciones con tan s\u00f3lo un voto.\n\n\nUn \nevmCallScript\n es la concatencaci\u00f3n de m\u00faltiples \nevmCallActions\n. Una carga de pago de una \nevmCallAction\n puede ser:\n\n\n[ to (address: 20 bytes) ] [ calldataLength (uint32: 4 bytes)  ] [ calldata (calldataLength bytes) ]\n\n\nCuando son ejecutadas, las acciones en el \nevmCallScript\n son ejecutadas una cada vez usando el \nCALL\n opcode. Si alguna de las acciones fallase (p.ej. \nCALL\n retorna 0), la ejecuci\u00f3n completa es revertida.\n\n\nLa referencia de implementaci\u00f3n para EVM Call Script puede ser encontrada aqu\u00ed: \nEVMCallScript.sol\n.\n\n\nSi un usuario quiere realizar una acci\u00f3n que no puede ser llevada a cabo directamente, puede comprobar si hay forwarders. Esto comprueba si hay entidades que pueden realizar la acci\u00f3n que cualquiera de las direcciones de usuario puede usar.\n\n\nEsto puede tener m\u00faltiples niveles de profundidad. Por ejemplo, si un usuario mantiene un n\u00famero de tokens, se permite que el usuario use la entidad gestor de tokens. Esto es algo que se pasa cuando el remitente posee tokens. Entonces se permite solo una vez que la entidad gestora de tokens cree un nuevo voto.\n\n\n2. Capacidad de actualizaci\u00f3n\n\n\nLa capacidad de actualizaci\u00f3n del sistema se consigue mediante el uso del patr\u00f3n \nDelegateProxy\n. El Kernel y las Aplicaciones (\nKernelProxy\n y \nAppProxy\n) usan el DelegateProxy con algunas ligeras modificaciones.\n\n\n\n\nDada la ejecuci\u00f3n de nuevas versiones de aplicaciones o del kernel en el mismo contexto exacto que las versiones anteriores, la disposici\u00f3n del almacenamiento anterior tiene que ser tomada en consideraci\u00f3n. Heredar del alamacenamiento del contrato anterior antes de a\u00f1adir nuevas variables de almacenamiento es considerado una pr\u00e1ctica segura. Es recomendado asegurarse de que la actualizaci\u00f3n no rompe el almacenamiento antes de desplegar la nueva versi\u00f3n. Trabajaremos en herramientas que prevengan problemas con el almacenamiento durante una actualizaci\u00f3n.\n\n\n2.1. Capacidad de actualizaci\u00f3n del Kernel\n\n\nPara que el \nKernel\n sea f\u00e1cilmente actualizable, r\u00e1pidamente desplegable, y m\u00e1s eficiente, usamos un constructo tipo proxy. El despliegue de una nueva DAO se consigue mediante el despliegue de un contrato \nKernelProxy\n que simplemente delega todas las llamadas a una implementacion de un kernel en una direcci\u00f3n dada, mientras que sigue manteniendo su propio alamacenamiento. La actualizaci\u00f3n de la implementaci\u00f3n del kernel en el proxy es tan f\u00e1cil como cambiar su referencia a otra direcci\u00f3n de implementaci\u00f3n. Incluso aunque esta acci\u00f3n es bastante f\u00e1cil de completar, es extremadamente cr\u00edtica para la DAO y deber\u00eda ser protegida en concordancia.\n\n\n2.2. Capacidad de actualizaci\u00f3n del espacio de aplicaciones\n\n\nComo las aplicaciones pueden ser usadas como entidades (p.ej. una voting app), es importante que cada aplicaci\u00f3n sea capaz de mantener su direcci\u00f3n fija, para as\u00ed mantener su identidad incluso si hay cambios de actualizaci\u00f3n por debajo de la l\u00f3gica. Esto es para mantener los permisos sin cambios a nivel de kernel con las actualizaciones.\n\n\nUna idea de como esto puede ser conseguido es a trav\u00e9s del concepto de un contrato \nAppProxy\n (inspirado por el \naugur-core\u2019s \nDelegators\n). El despliegue de una aplicaci\u00f3n via un contrato \nAppProxy\n solo requiere una referencia al Kernel y a la identificaci\u00f3n de la aplicaci\u00f3n. Cuando una aplicaci\u00f3n recibe una llamada, es interceptada por la funci\u00f3n callback del proxy. En este punto, el proxy pregunta al Kernel por las \u00faltimas direcciones del c\u00f3digo de la aplicaci\u00f3n para un identificador de aplicaci\u00f3n dado y versi\u00f3n. El contrato AppProxy entonces reenv\u00eda la llamada \ndelegatecall\n hacia su direcci\u00f3n, asegur\u00e1ndose de que la \u00faltima versi\u00f3n de la aplicaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 siempre corriendo.\n\n\n\n\nDado que el Kernel mantiene un registro centralizado de la \u00faltima versi\u00f3n del c\u00f3digo para cada identificador de aplicaci\u00f3n, el cambio de una referencia en el Kernel actualiza de manera efectiva todas las instancias de esa aplicaci\u00f3n en las organizaciones que dependen del mismo Kernel. Estas actualizaciones podr\u00edan ser delegadas a otro contrato, Aragon Network, en caso de organizaciones que no quieran encargarse de la actualizaci\u00f3n manual de sus propias aplicaciones.\n\n\nkernel.setAppCode(bytes32 appId, address appCode)\n\n\n\n\n\nEsta acci\u00f3n actualiza el c\u00f3digo de implementaci\u00f3n registrado para un \nappId\n dado. Esto actualiza efectivamente la aplicaci\u00f3n en todas las organizaciones que dependen del mismo Kernel. Si un \nappId\nno ha sido establecido para ese \nappCode\n, todas las llamadas a una aplicaci\u00f3n fallar\u00e1n.\n\n\n3. Inicializaci\u00f3n\n\n\nLos contratos que se despliegan no contienen ninguna l\u00f3gica de negocio para el componente. Esto es debido a que el Kernel y las Aplicaciones dependen de una arquitectura tipo Proxy para su actualizaci\u00f3n.\n\n\nEsto impide la habilidad de llamar al constructor. Los constructures solo son ejecutados en la creaci\u00f3n de un contrato pero no son almacenados como parte del c\u00f3digo de cuenta.\n\n\nLa inicializaci\u00f3n es realizada mediante una 'funci\u00f3n regular' quedeber\u00eda ser llamada solo despu\u00e9s de que un contrato \nAppProxy\n sea desplegado. Para impedir ataques en los que el actor malicioso intenta hacer frente a una transacci\u00f3n de inicializaci\u00f3n entre el despliegue y la transacci\u00f3n leg\u00edtima de inicializaci\u00f3n, el \nAppProxy\n te permite pasar s\u00f3lo la carga de pago de inicializaci\u00f3n que ser\u00e1 ejecutada durante el despliegue, permitiendo la inicializaci\u00f3n at\u00f3mica de las aplicaciones.\n\n\nEs importante resaltar que esta funci\u00f3n de inicializaci\u00f3n puede ser llamada solo una vez por proxy. En vez de simplemente guardar un buleano cuando un componente ha sido inicializado, nosotros almacenamos un n\u00famero de bloque cuando la inicializaci\u00f3n ha ocurrido. Los clientes puede usar esto para saber desde qu\u00e9 bloque deber\u00edan filtrar para eventos.\n\n\n4. Descubrimiento de aplicaciones y versionado de paquetes\n\n\nUna aplicaci\u00f3n \nA\n no es m\u00e1s que un simple contrato \nAppProxy\n que mantiene una referencia a un kernel \nK\n y a un \nappId\n. Si \nA\n no tiene ning\u00fan permiso, entrante o saliente, establecido en \nK\n, \nA\n es efectivamente irrelevante para la DAO ya que no puede ser llamada ni realizar ninguna llamada por s\u00ed misma. As\u00ed que la noci\u00f3n de instalar una aplicaci\u00f3n se reemplaza por la noci\u00f3n de crear permisos para una aplicaci\u00f3n (lo que tiene que suceder para que las diferentes funciones de una aplicaci\u00f3n sean llamadas y lo que puede hacer una aplicaci\u00f3n para otras aplicaciones).\n\n\nTodas las aplicaciones relevantes en una DAO deber\u00edan poder ser descubiertas recorriendo la ACL, comprobando si algunas direcciones son AppProxys, y comprobando si esas AppProxys tienen una referencia al kernel de la DAO. Si esto sucede, una aplicaci\u00f3n con el \nappId\n del AppProxy se considera instalada de manera efectiva en la DAO.\n\n\nEl identificador de una aplicaci\u00f3n (\nappId\n) puede ser usado como un identificador por su paquete completo (el frontend de la aplicaci\u00f3n y otros artefactos). El \nappId\n de una aplicaci\u00f3n deber\u00eda ser el nombre ENS del paquete. La funci\u00f3n \nnamehash\n crea el hash de manera recursiva de los diferentes componentes de un nombre (\nreference implementation\n)\n\n\nappId = namehash(\u201cvoting.aragonpm.eth\u201d)\n\n\n\n\n\nAragon posee \naragonpm.eth\n y permitir\u00e1 a los desarrolladores crear paquetes, pero el sistema est\u00e1 designado para ser agn\u00f3stico en dominio (por ejemplo, district0x podr\u00eda decidir tener todos sus paquetes colgando de \npackages.district.eth\n).\n\n\nDespu\u00e9s de descubrir que una entidad en la DAO es una aplicaci\u00f3n, podemos recuperar su appId y ya que el appId es un nombre ENS, podemos mirar en el ENS para encontrar el contrato del repo completo para un appId.\n\n\nrepo = Resolver(ens.resolver(appId)).addr(appId)\n\n\n\n\n\nLos contratos Repo se ajustan al Protocolo de Versionado de Aragon original pero a\u00f1aden m\u00e1s comprobaciones on-chain para actualizaciones de versi\u00f3n.\n\n\nCada Repo tiene un poseedor que es una direcci\u00f3n Ethereum que puede crear nuevas versiones del paquete. Este derecho de posesi\u00f3n puede ser transferido a otra direcci\u00f3n por parte del poseedor.\n\n\nUn Repo mantiene un estado versionado sobre:\n\n\n\n\nEl c\u00f3digo de la aplicaci\u00f3n del contrato inteligente (\ncontractAddress\n): el c\u00f3digo de la aplicaci\u00f3n es la direcci\u00f3n de la versi\u00f3n de despliegue de la aplicaci\u00f3n. El Kernel puede entonces apuntar a esta direcci\u00f3n y a todas las instancias de la aplicaci\u00f3n, dependiendo del Kernel que la misma use.\n\n\nContenido del paquete (\ncontentURI\n): definido por un id de localizaci\u00f3n de d\u00f3nde est\u00e1 alojado el paquete (IPFS, Swarm, etc.) y el hash del contenido para recuperarlo.\n\n\n\n\nMediante la referencia del c\u00f3digo de la aplicaci\u00f3n y el contenido del paquete, podemos establecer algunas garant\u00edas de lo que significa el versionado sem\u00e1ntico.\n\n\n\n\nPatch\n: Cambios menores en el contenido del paquete (frontend). Esta actualizaci\u00f3n puede ser realizada sin notificar al usuario.\n\n\nMinor\n: Cambios mayores en el contenido del paquete, pero todav\u00eda funcionando con el actual c\u00f3digo del contrato inteligente (frontend). Los usuarios deber\u00edan ser notificados de la actualizaci\u00f3n.\n\n\nMajor\n: Cambios en los contratos inteligentes y el frontend. Para usar esta versi\u00f3n del frontend, se requiere una actualizaci\u00f3n a los contratos inteligentes nuevos. Se requiere interacci\u00f3n con el usuario para la actualizaci\u00f3n.\n\n\n\n\nMediante esta comprobaci\u00f3n realizada a nivel de contrato inteligente, podemos cargar la versi\u00f3n correcta del frontend solo mirando una instancia de la aplicaci\u00f3n. Esto se hace mediante la comprobaci\u00f3n de que la versi\u00f3n de un contrato inteligente est\u00e1 enlazada a una aplicaci\u00f3n dada a trav\u00e9s de la recuperaci\u00f3n del appId y el appCode.\n\n\nUna actualizaci\u00f3n de versi\u00f3n correcta para un paquete est\u00e1 definida por las siguientes reglas:\n\n\n\n\nSolo un miembro de la versi\u00f3n ser\u00e1 incrementado en 1. Los componentes de la versi\u00f3n a la izquierda del n\u00famero elevando deben permanecer igual y los componentes a su derecha deben ser igual a 0.\n\n\nEjemplo: Desde 2.1.3 las \u00fanicas actualizaciones posibles son 3.0.0 (major version), 2.2.0 (minor version), y 2.1.4 (patch version).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLos cambios en la direcci\u00f3n del c\u00f3digo de la aplicaci\u00f3n pueden ser realizados solo si la actualizaci\u00f3n cambia la major version (actualiz\u00e1ndola a x.0.0 seg\u00fan la regla anterior).\n\n\n\n\nEl paquete que est\u00e1 almacenado off-chain debe contener un est\u00e1ndar \nmanifest.json\n. Aparte de lo anterior, para hacer posible la interacci\u00f3n con los contratos inteligentes, introducimos un archivo espec\u00edfico \neth.json\n con las siguientes claves:\n\n\n\n\nabi\n: Est\u00e1ndar \nEthereum Contract ABI\n\n\nbytecode\n: C\u00f3digo de inicializaci\u00f3n para desplegar el c\u00f3digo de una aplicaci\u00f3n en la red.\n\n\nfunctions\n: Un vector de todas las firmas de funci\u00f3n relevantes para el contrato, con su descripci\u00f3n \nnatspec\n, nombres de argumento, y si la funci\u00f3n est\u00e1 protegida por el ACL o no (y en qu\u00e9 rol est\u00e1 requerido, si est\u00e1 protegido). Estos pueden ser autom\u00e1ticamente generados durante la publicaci\u00f3n del paquete.\n\n\npermissions\n: Un vector de permisos que la aplicaci\u00f3n necesita tener sobre otras entidades para poder funcionar. Esto probablemente  ser\u00e1 dependiente de los par\u00e1metro de inicializaci\u00f3n. Por ejemplo: una aplicaci\u00f3n de Finanzas necesitar\u00e1 permisos sobre el Vault con el que ha sido inicializado.\n\n\nverification\n: Un objeto que provee la informaci\u00f3n requerida para verificar de manera independiente el c\u00f3digo fuente del c\u00f3digo desplegado. Los valores requeridos incluyen: \ndeployTxId\n, \nsourceCode\n, y la configuraci\u00f3n del compilador, la versi\u00f3n solc, y las configuraciones de optimizaci\u00f3n.\n\n\n\n\nUna implementaci\u00f3n inicial de los contratos que soportan la gesti\u00f3n de paquetes puede ser encontrada en el \nrepo GitHub apm-contracts\n.",

En este punto, el proxy pregunta al Kernel por las \u00faltimas direcciones del c\u00f3digo de la aplicaci\u00f3n para un identificador de aplicaci\u00f3n dado y versi\u00f3n. El contrato AppProxy entonces reenv\u00eda la llamada  delegatecall  hacia su direcci\u00f3n, asegur\u00e1ndose de que la \u00faltima versi\u00f3n de la aplicaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 siempre corriendo.   Dado que el Kernel mantiene un registro centralizado de la \u00faltima versi\u00f3n del c\u00f3digo para cada identificador de aplicaci\u00f3n, el cambio de una referencia en el Kernel actualiza de manera efectiva todas las instancias de esa aplicaci\u00f3n en las organizaciones que dependen del mismo Kernel. Estas actualizaciones podr\u00edan ser delegadas a otro contrato, Aragon Network, en caso de organizaciones que no quieran encargarse de la actualizaci\u00f3n manual de sus propias aplicaciones.  kernel.setAppCode(bytes32 appId, address appCode)  Esta acci\u00f3n actualiza el c\u00f3digo de implementaci\u00f3n registrado para un  appId  dado. Esto actualiza efectivamente la aplicaci\u00f3n en todas las organizaciones que dependen del mismo Kernel. Si un  appId no ha sido establecido para ese  appCode , todas las llamadas a una aplicaci\u00f3n fallar\u00e1n.",

            "text": "Los contratos que se despliegan no contienen ninguna l\u00f3gica de negocio para el componente. Esto es debido a que el Kernel y las Aplicaciones dependen de una arquitectura tipo Proxy para su actualizaci\u00f3n.  Esto impide la habilidad de llamar al constructor. Los constructures solo son ejecutados en la creaci\u00f3n de un contrato pero no son almacenados como parte del c\u00f3digo de cuenta.  La inicializaci\u00f3n es realizada mediante una 'funci\u00f3n regular' quedeber\u00eda ser llamada solo despu\u00e9s de que un contrato  AppProxy  sea desplegado. Para impedir ataques en los que el actor malicioso intenta hacer frente a una transacci\u00f3n de inicializaci\u00f3n entre el despliegue y la transacci\u00f3n leg\u00edtima de inicializaci\u00f3n, el  AppProxy  te permite pasar s\u00f3lo la carga de pago de inicializaci\u00f3n que ser\u00e1 ejecutada durante el despliegue, permitiendo la inicializaci\u00f3n at\u00f3mica de las aplicaciones.  Es importante resaltar que esta funci\u00f3n de inicializaci\u00f3n puede ser llamada solo una vez por proxy. En vez de simplemente guardar un buleano cuando un componente ha sido inicializado, nosotros almacenamos un n\u00famero de bloque cuando la inicializaci\u00f3n ha ocurrido.

            "text": "Una aplicaci\u00f3n  A  no es m\u00e1s que un simple contrato  AppProxy  que mantiene una referencia a un kernel  K  y a un  appId . Si  A  no tiene ning\u00fan permiso, entrante o saliente, establecido en  K ,  A  es efectivamente irrelevante para la DAO ya que no puede ser llamada ni realizar ninguna llamada por s\u00ed misma. As\u00ed que la noci\u00f3n de instalar una aplicaci\u00f3n se reemplaza por la noci\u00f3n de crear permisos para una aplicaci\u00f3n (lo que tiene que suceder para que las diferentes funciones de una aplicaci\u00f3n sean llamadas y lo que puede hacer una aplicaci\u00f3n para otras aplicaciones).  Todas las aplicaciones relevantes en una DAO deber\u00edan poder ser descubiertas recorriendo la ACL, comprobando si algunas direcciones son AppProxys, y comprobando si esas AppProxys tienen una referencia al kernel de la DAO. Si esto sucede, una aplicaci\u00f3n con el  appId  del AppProxy se considera instalada de manera efectiva en la DAO.  El identificador de una aplicaci\u00f3n ( appId ) puede ser usado como un identificador por su paquete completo (el frontend de la aplicaci\u00f3n y otros artefactos). El  appId  de una aplicaci\u00f3n deber\u00eda ser el nombre ENS del paquete. La funci\u00f3n  namehash  crea el hash de manera recursiva de los diferentes componentes de un nombre ( reference implementation )  appId = namehash(\u201cvoting.aragonpm.eth\u201d)  Aragon posee  aragonpm.eth  y permitir\u00e1 a los desarrolladores crear paquetes, pero el sistema est\u00e1 designado para ser agn\u00f3stico en dominio (por ejemplo, district0x podr\u00eda decidir tener todos sus paquetes colgando de  packages.district.eth ).  Despu\u00e9s de descubrir que una entidad en la DAO es una aplicaci\u00f3n, podemos recuperar su appId y ya que el appId es un nombre ENS, podemos mirar en el ENS para encontrar el contrato del repo completo para un appId.  repo = Resolver(ens.resolver(appId)).addr(appId)  Los contratos Repo se ajustan al Protocolo de Versionado de Aragon original pero a\u00f1aden m\u00e1s comprobaciones on-chain para actualizaciones de versi\u00f3n.  Cada Repo tiene un poseedor que es una direcci\u00f3n Ethereum que puede crear nuevas versiones del paquete. Este derecho de posesi\u00f3n puede ser transferido a otra direcci\u00f3n por parte del poseedor.  Un Repo mantiene un estado versionado sobre:   El c\u00f3digo de la aplicaci\u00f3n del contrato inteligente ( contractAddress ): el c\u00f3digo de la aplicaci\u00f3n es la direcci\u00f3n de la versi\u00f3n de despliegue de la aplicaci\u00f3n. El Kernel puede entonces apuntar a esta direcci\u00f3n y a todas las instancias de la aplicaci\u00f3n, dependiendo del Kernel que la misma use.  Contenido del paquete ( contentURI ): definido por un id de localizaci\u00f3n de d\u00f3nde est\u00e1 alojado el paquete (IPFS, Swarm, etc.) y el hash del contenido para recuperarlo.   Mediante la referencia del c\u00f3digo de la aplicaci\u00f3n y el contenido del paquete, podemos establecer algunas garant\u00edas de lo que significa el versionado sem\u00e1ntico.   Patch : Cambios menores en el contenido del paquete (frontend). Esta actualizaci\u00f3n puede ser realizada sin notificar al usuario.  Minor : Cambios mayores en el contenido del paquete, pero todav\u00eda funcionando con el actual c\u00f3digo del contrato inteligente (frontend). Los usuarios deber\u00edan ser notificados de la actualizaci\u00f3n.  Major : Cambios en los contratos inteligentes y el frontend. Para usar esta versi\u00f3n del frontend, se requiere una actualizaci\u00f3n a los contratos inteligentes nuevos. Se requiere interacci\u00f3n con el usuario para la actualizaci\u00f3n.   Mediante esta comprobaci\u00f3n realizada a nivel de contrato inteligente, podemos cargar la versi\u00f3n correcta del frontend solo mirando una instancia de la aplicaci\u00f3n. Esto se hace mediante la comprobaci\u00f3n de que la versi\u00f3n de un contrato inteligente est\u00e1 enlazada a una aplicaci\u00f3n dada a trav\u00e9s de la recuperaci\u00f3n del appId y el appCode.  Una actualizaci\u00f3n de versi\u00f3n correcta para un paquete est\u00e1 definida por las siguientes reglas:   Solo un miembro de la versi\u00f3n ser\u00e1 incrementado en 1. Los componentes de la versi\u00f3n a la izquierda del n\u00famero elevando deben permanecer igual y los componentes a su derecha deben ser igual a 0.  Ejemplo: Desde 2.1.3 las \u00fanicas actualizaciones posibles son 3.0.0 (major version), 2.2.0 (minor version), y 2.1.4 (patch version).    Los cambios en la direcci\u00f3n del c\u00f3digo de la aplicaci\u00f3n pueden ser realizados solo si la actualizaci\u00f3n cambia la major version (actualiz\u00e1ndola a x.0.0 seg\u00fan la regla anterior).   El paquete que est\u00e1 almacenado off-chain debe contener un est\u00e1ndar  manifest.json . Aparte de lo anterior, para hacer posible la interacci\u00f3n con los contratos inteligentes, introducimos un archivo espec\u00edfico  eth.json  con las siguientes claves:   abi : Est\u00e1ndar  Ethereum Contract ABI  bytecode : C\u00f3digo de inicializaci\u00f3n para desplegar el c\u00f3digo de una aplicaci\u00f3n en la red.  functions : Un vector de todas las firmas de funci\u00f3n relevantes para el contrato, con su descripci\u00f3n  natspec , nombres de argumento, y si la funci\u00f3n est\u00e1 protegida por el ACL o no (y en qu\u00e9 rol est\u00e1 requerido, si est\u00e1 protegido). Estos pueden ser autom\u00e1ticamente generados durante la publicaci\u00f3n del paquete.  permissions : Un vector de permisos que la aplicaci\u00f3n necesita tener sobre otras entidades para poder funcionar. Esto probablemente  ser\u00e1 dependiente de los par\u00e1metro de inicializaci\u00f3n. Por ejemplo: una aplicaci\u00f3n de Finanzas necesitar\u00e1 permisos sobre el Vault con el que ha sido inicializado.  verification : Un objeto que provee la informaci\u00f3n requerida para verificar de manera independiente el c\u00f3digo fuente del c\u00f3digo desplegado. Los valores requeridos incluyen:  deployTxId ,  sourceCode , y la configuraci\u00f3n del compilador, la versi\u00f3n solc, y las configuraciones de optimizaci\u00f3n.   Una implementaci\u00f3n inicial de los contratos que soportan la gesti\u00f3n de paquetes puede ser encontrada en el  repo GitHub apm-contracts .",

Se conocieron a trav\u00e9s de Twitter con tan solo 15 a\u00f1os de edad, e inmediatamente empezaron a crear productos mano a mano.\n\n\nA los 17 a\u00f1os, prototiparon un sustituto de Internet totalmente descentralizado usando redes en malla (mesh networks), tecnolog\u00eda blockchain y protocolos como Bluetooth LE y WiFi Direct.\n\n\nStampery\n\u2013 la compa\u00f1\u00eda m\u00e1s reciente de Luis \u2013 hizo que las marcas de tiempo (timestamps) en blockchain fueran accesibles y ha trabajado con instituciones como el gobierno de Estonia, Microsoft y Telef\u00f3nica.

Despu\u00e9s de darse cuenta lo rota que estaba la infraestructura de innovaci\u00f3n \u2013 los trolles de patentes a la alza, Donald Trump ganando las elecciones, la burocracia comi\u00e9ndose al emprendimiento \u2013 ellos decidieron enfocar todo su tiempo en construir la infraestructura sobre la cual se administrar\u00e1n las nuevas compa\u00f1\u00edas y organizaciones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl hablar de Aragon, es sano dar un paso atr\u00e1s y pensar en el por qu\u00e9 de las estructura organizacionales. Las compa\u00f1\u00edas existen para crear valor, usando recursos para crear productos u ofrecer servicios. Sin embargo, los intermediarios o terceros, como los gobiernos, disminuyen el resultado de estas organizaciones, imponiendo restricciones y creando marcos de trabajo regulatorio muy complejos. Aragon naci\u00f3 para desintermediar la creaci\u00f3n y el mantenimiento de compa\u00f1\u00edas y otras estructuras organizacionales.\n\n\nLuis y Jorge fueron profundamente inspirados por el Premio Nobel Ronald Coase y su fant\u00e1stico ensayo \nLa Naturaleza de la Empresa\n (The Nature of the Firm), adem\u00e1s de \nLinux y la Naturaleza de la Empresa\n (Linux and the Nature of the Firm) de Yochai Benkler. Ambos exploran el concepto de compa\u00f1\u00eda.\n\n\nEn Aragon Dev, creemos que blockchain e Internet est\u00e1n cambiando la motivaci\u00f3n de las compa\u00f1\u00edas para existir, y estamos construyendo herramientas para la siguiente generaci\u00f3n de compa\u00f1\u00edas que aprovechar\u00e1n las ventajas de estos cambios.\n\n\nSin embargo, para que una organizaci\u00f3n descentralizada se extienda, necesitamos asegurar que esas herramientas son f\u00e1ciles de usar, actualizables/durables y capaces de resolver disputas humanas.\n\n\nQueremos solucionar \u2013 ya sea nosotros o asoci\u00e1ndose con otros \u2013 esos puntos para as\u00ed poder expandir las organizaciones descentralizadas.\n\n\nGracias a la dapp de Aragon y a La Aragon Network, podremos solucionar esos puntos.\n\n\nEstructura Organizacional\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLa Comunidad Aragon\n, definiendo los miembros de la comunidad que contribuyen a la dapp y a La Aragon Network, as\u00ed como los due\u00f1os de tokens de La Aragon Network.\n\n\nAragon MTU\n, desde ahora \nla Fundaci\u00f3n\n, es una organizaci\u00f3n sin \u00e1nimo de lucro basada en Estonia, que servir\u00e1 como organizaci\u00f3n paraguas responsable de asignar recursos al resto de cuerpos para futuras investigaciones sobre criptomonedas y desarrollo llendo hacia delante.

Se conocieron a trav\u00e9s de Twitter con tan solo 15 a\u00f1os de edad, e inmediatamente empezaron a crear productos mano a mano.  A los 17 a\u00f1os, prototiparon un sustituto de Internet totalmente descentralizado usando redes en malla (mesh networks), tecnolog\u00eda blockchain y protocolos como Bluetooth LE y WiFi Direct.  Stampery \u2013 la compa\u00f1\u00eda m\u00e1s reciente de Luis \u2013 hizo que las marcas de tiempo (timestamps) en blockchain fueran accesibles y ha trabajado con instituciones como el gobierno de Estonia, Microsoft y Telef\u00f3nica. Ha participado en TechCrunch Disrupt y ha sido apoyado por el billonario Tim Draper.  Luis tambi\u00e9n ha sido reconocido en  30 Under 30 de Forbes , as\u00ed como  Innovator Under 35 de the\nMIT .  Antes de construir Aragon, Luis y Jorge estaban en Silicon Valley tratando de resolver el problema de los trolles de patentes con Unpatent. Despu\u00e9s de darse cuenta lo rota que estaba la infraestructura de innovaci\u00f3n \u2013 los trolles de patentes a la alza, Donald Trump ganando las elecciones, la burocracia comi\u00e9ndose al emprendimiento \u2013 ellos decidieron enfocar todo su tiempo en construir la infraestructura sobre la cual se administrar\u00e1n las nuevas compa\u00f1\u00edas y organizaciones.     Al hablar de Aragon, es sano dar un paso atr\u00e1s y pensar en el por qu\u00e9 de las estructura organizacionales. Las compa\u00f1\u00edas existen para crear valor, usando recursos para crear productos u ofrecer servicios. Sin embargo, los intermediarios o terceros, como los gobiernos, disminuyen el resultado de estas organizaciones, imponiendo restricciones y creando marcos de trabajo regulatorio muy complejos. Aragon naci\u00f3 para desintermediar la creaci\u00f3n y el mantenimiento de compa\u00f1\u00edas y otras estructuras organizacionales.  Luis y Jorge fueron profundamente inspirados por el Premio Nobel Ronald Coase y su fant\u00e1stico ensayo  La Naturaleza de la Empresa  (The Nature of the Firm), adem\u00e1s de  Linux y la Naturaleza de la Empresa  (Linux and the Nature of the Firm) de Yochai Benkler. Ambos exploran el concepto de compa\u00f1\u00eda.  En Aragon Dev, creemos que blockchain e Internet est\u00e1n cambiando la motivaci\u00f3n de las compa\u00f1\u00edas para existir, y estamos construyendo herramientas para la siguiente generaci\u00f3n de compa\u00f1\u00edas que aprovechar\u00e1n las ventajas de estos cambios.  Sin embargo, para que una organizaci\u00f3n descentralizada se extienda, necesitamos asegurar que esas herramientas son f\u00e1ciles de usar, actualizables/durables y capaces de resolver disputas humanas.  Queremos solucionar \u2013 ya sea nosotros o asoci\u00e1ndose con otros \u2013 esos puntos para as\u00ed poder expandir las organizaciones descentralizadas.  Gracias a la dapp de Aragon y a La Aragon Network, podremos solucionar esos puntos.",
